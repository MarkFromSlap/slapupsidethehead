![Out of Town, Folks!]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/06/out_of_town.jpg' | relative_url}})

Well, I'm out of town for today, folks! But, never fear! I've prepared a special **out-of-town update** to let you know how some of those crazy anti-gay characters I've been telling you about are getting along!

![Harper Muzzle]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/06/harper_muzzle.jpg' | relative_url}})

Super crazy prime minister extrodinare, Stephen Harper, [sent out a notice](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060526/mounties_wedding_060526/20060526?hub=Canada "More like a muzzle, really") to his caucus last week, informing MPs that they are **not** to comment on the [two gay mounties](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/mounties-get-their-man/ "It's adorable, really!") that are marrying this month. While Conservative MPs had no comment (_duh_), Liberal MP Scott Brison put it best: "If [Stephen Harper] doesn't trust his caucus to be socially progressive, then why should Canadians trust his party to be socially progressive?" Sing it, bro!

![Reassigned]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/06/reassigned.jpg' | relative_url}})

The former principal found to have violated human rights codes for [assuming a gay teacher was molesting students](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/gym-teacher-washes-hands/ "Because... why did he assume this again?") has [been reassigned](http://thechronicleherald.ca/Front/507436.html "Hooray?") by the Halifax Regional School Board. And what, you may ask, is the job he's being forced to give up? Why, **director of human rights policies,** of course! A job that he held for _over a year_ even though the human rights violation occurred 6 years ago! Compounded with the bizarre survey [asking gay teachers to identify themselves](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/halifaxs-teacher-survey/ "Seriously, why?"), the board doesn't seem to be particularly big on diversity...

And that, my _scrumptious_ little readers, is the out-of-town update!
