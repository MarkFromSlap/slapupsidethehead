Defend Traditional Marriage and Family, an anti-gay lobby group, is trying to ban a book entitled [Open Minds to Equality](http://www.amazon.com/Open-Minds-Equality-Sourcebook-Activities/dp/020516109X "Dangerous Ideas Within!") because it presents a "morally neutral" view of homosexuality. The book, an optional teacher's resource for the Waterloo Catholic District School Board, is unavailable to students.

Jack Fonseca, the lobby group's spokesperson, said that Catholic teachers should not have the option to read the resource because "[it] could have the effect of encouraging students and teachers to view the gay lifestyle as being morally neutral," adding "they will have been led to reject Jesus." In an open letter, the group stated that "the effect of this book is to indoctrinate teachers and children to accept and celebrate homosexuality under the guise of 'diversity' and 'equality.'"

So, which is it? Is the book "morally neutral," or something that "indoctrinates" readers to "celebrate" homosexuality? Frankly, I don't think that Defend Traditional Marriage and Family distinguishes the two. Anything that acknowledges the existence of homosexuality without condemning it is akin to "celebrating the gay lifestyle" in their eyes. And that's enough for them to lobby to ensure teachers are ill-equipped to dealing with issues that gay students face.
