![And she's French, too.](/wp-content/media/2008/12/gay-beacon.jpg "And she's French, too.")

Fresh off the Vatican's [refusal to support](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/12/vatican-fights-to-keep-homosexuality-criminalized/ "They're just wacky that way, aren't they?") a UN statement decrying the criminalization of homosexuality, the United States is stalling their signature approving the symbolic declaration.

While the United States has plenty of precedent to sign the statement, including a similar declaration before the 2006 Human Rights Council in Geneva, the delay is unusual---and the deadline is looming.

Over 50 countries worldwide have signed the declaration, including Canada. The U.S. might be a little slow, but that's forgivable; they're in the middle of a [somewhat important transition](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/11/to-my-american-friends/ "Thought I can't imagine what took them so long..."), those cuties.
