Bethany Smith, a lesbian seeking refugee status in Canada from the U.S., will get a second chance to have her case heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board after the Federal Court ruled that her previous plea was wrongfully dismissed.

Bethany, a 21 year old U.S. soldier, fled the U.S. in September 2007 over the institutionalized homophobia in the country's army. Bethany says that other soldiers discovered she was a lesbian after seeing her hold hands with another woman at a shopping mall. Gays and lesbians are forbidden to serve openly in the U.S. army, so this information was used to harass, blackmail, and threaten her with violence---with no available recourse in the army's administration.

The Immigration and Refugee Board originally rejected Bethany's case in February, but will now give her a second chance with a different adjudicator. The Federal Court says the IRB should have taken into account "the particular environment" at Bethany's Kentucky army base, including information that a gay man was murdered there in 1999 by fellow soldiers as he slept.

Considering Canada's abysmal record on these sorts of cases, I don't know how much of a chance Bethany has of getting full refugee status. Still, I wish her the best, as well as the speedy turfing of the U.S's terrible _Don't Ask, Don't Tell_ policy and other forms of institutionalized homophobia!
