![](/wp-content/media/2010/01/postman.jpg "Sorry to all the real Mrs. Jone's out there. Your habits have been outed.")

Anyone who requested a sexy underwear catalogue from Priape, Canada's most well-known gay adult store, may be surprised to discover that their discreet, opaque packaging suddenly isn't as discreet as it used to be. In fact, Priape reports that many have been prominently stamped with the words "adult material."

The stamp was put there without Priape's knowledge by Canada Post, our beloved mail carriers,  in conformance with new policies on "non-mailable matter." These policies, which came into effect just over a year ago, now mandate that all "sexually suggestive" admail---even commercial mail that is explicitly addressed to the recipient---be clearly labelled as adult material, thwarting all attempts at discretion. This includes all images "that are suggestive of sexual activity," as well as text that "describes sexual acts in a way that is more than purely technical." (Ooh, _saucy_!)

A spokesperson for Canada Post told Xtra that this policy was all to protect the wee ones, explaining: "If you send it to a family and the children open the parcel, now that could be a problem."

Yes, children opening nondescript envelopes that weren't addressed to them would be a problem, wouldn't it? It's a good thing stamping "adult material" on the parcel will stop them; why, no curious kid would _dare_ open a mysterious, _forbidden_ envelope, labelled strictly for adults only. So thanks, Canada Post, for taking parenting responsibilities out of the hands of, well, parents, who are too burdened to ensure that their solicited, adult-ish materials stay out of their own children's grasp.
