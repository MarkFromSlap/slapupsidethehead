![Gay Christmas Gift]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/12/gay-xmas-gift.jpg' | relative_url}})

Hey kids!

Well, I'm taking a short break for the holidays.

On behalf of this abstract collection of electronic bits called a website, have an _exceptionally_ fantastic holiday! And, for those that celebrate it, may your Christmas be joyful and gay... in a homosexual way, if applicable.

Take care, folks!
