After a three year battle, an appeals court in New York has ruled that Canadian same-sex marriages are valid in the state and must be respected by company spousal health plans.

The ruling means that Patricia Martinez---a supervisor at Monroe Community College in Rochester---may now extend spousal benefits to her wife, Lisa Ann Golden, just like any heterosexual employee. Patricia sued the college for these benefits in 2005, but a lower court sided with the college, arguing that the couple's Canadian same-sex marriage was not a real marriage.

After the appeals ruling, several hundred thousand traditional families throughout the state spontaneously detonated.
