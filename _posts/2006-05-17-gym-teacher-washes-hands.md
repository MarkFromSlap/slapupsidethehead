![Aaaaah! The Gays!]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/05/snap_accusation.jpg' | relative_url}})

Lindsay Willow is a gym teacher. She is also a lesbian. One fine September, Ms. Willow was busy organizing an equipment storage room with a student helper. After the room was all tidy, they both washed their hands and stepped into the hallway. The end.

Oh, wait, no; I forgot to mention---one more thing happened. A minor detail, really. You see, at that moment, a fellow teacher saw the two leaving the locker room and, because Ms. Willow is gay, _presumed her to be a child molester!_ He then presented outlandish allegations to his colleagues, the principal, and, of course, the police. The former two believed the loony yarn without _any_ evidence whatsoever, and Ms. Willow was severely disciplined.

Sound unbelievable? Well, it happened! The [Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission](http://www.gov.ns.ca/humanrights/ "Da good guys") announced last week that Ms. Willow was falsely accused of molestation based solely on her sexual orientation. The tribunal then ordered the [Halifax Regional School Board](http://www.hrsb.ns.ca/ "And da bad guys") to deliver a full written apology and monetary compensation for their prejudiced nonsense. Because, you know, there's no heartfelt apology quite like a court-ordered heartfelt apology.

As for the moral of the story, let this be a lesson to all the gays out there: _Never wash your hands_.
