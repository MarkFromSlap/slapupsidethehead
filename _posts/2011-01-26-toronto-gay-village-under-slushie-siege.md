![An atlantic cod is hurled at a terrified young man.]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/01/atlantic-cod-attack.jpg' | relative_url}} "At least the Glee writers chose slushies instead of this.")

Toronto's Gay Village is a little on edge recently after a rash of slushie attacks.

Groups of teens from a nearby school, Jarvis Collegiate, have apparently been trolling the neighbourhood during lunch hour, picking anyone strolling along Church street and hurling slushies at them, Ã  la _Glee_. Unlike Glee, they're also hurling some nasty slurs.

Paul Winsor, a local florist and slushie victim, said that the slurs happen often, but didn't think the attacks are specifically targeting the gay community. "In my mind, it's a bunch of teenagers behaving badly all around," he told the Toronto Star. "I think it's general hooliganism; it's a crime of opportunity---whoever happens to be around."

Considering that Jarvis Collegiate is right in the middle of the Gay Village, and not all the victims have been gay, I'm inclined to agree. Although the slurs and general behaviour is certainly revealing of a larger homophobic problem in schools. After all, if this is the stuff that leaks out of the school into the general public, imagine what it must be like inside for students who are gay or perceived to be gay.

As for the slushie-slinging squad, may they all get brain freeze.
