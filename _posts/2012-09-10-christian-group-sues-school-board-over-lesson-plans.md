![A man dressed in black guards an encyclopedia.]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/09/encyclopedia-guard.jpg' | relative_url}} "You are only permitted to read pages 6, 42, and 518.")

A group calling itself the "Parental Rights in Education Defense Fund" along with an anonymous "beleaguered parent" is suing the Ontario school system for not providing advance notice of gay subject matter.

"The parent seeks nothing more than to be given advance notice so that he can [...] withdraw his children before the lesson," the group announced on Friday.

While the press release itself didn't mention gay issues specifically, the newly-formed group's website obsesses over the topic almost exclusively, also establishing their opposition to "misguided" Gay-Straight Alliances, and any book written by GLBT authors.

Say, isn't it odd that the same groups who often demand schools "teach the controversy" when it comes to learning about evolution and other scientific progresses, are so quick to censor and block other material? I spent my entire grade school education in the Catholic school system where gay topics were never discussed, probably on purpose. The only thing that withholding this information did for gay students like me was leave us uninformed and ignorant for many years before having to find out what we needed to know on our own from an uneven selection of reliable and unreliable sources.

At any rate, I want to offer a thought to this parent. Since he has chosen to sue the school board anonymously, let's refer to him as Count Moriarty Von Jafar IV.

Mr. Moriarty Von Jafar, expose your kids to as many ideas as possible and stop presuming ownership over their minds. By all means, introduce them to your own ideas (and trust me, there's plenty of time to teach your kids your own ideas; they don't have to always hear your worldview first), but have the responsibility to let them discover ideas you don't particularly like. Shielding them from a world you don't always see eye-to-eye with is a complete impossibility, and that's a wonderful thing. The less sheltered and more challenged a mind is, the more resilient and capable it becomes.
