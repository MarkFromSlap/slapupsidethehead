[Out Traveler](http://www.outtraveler.com/ "For travelers who are out, of course."), a gay and lesbian travel magazine, has named Canada's top 5 gayest cities. While I'm not going to list them here, let's just say that Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montr√©al should be expecting a few extra gay tourists this year! Wait, that might be a little too obvious. How about: Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto and Montreal should be expecting a few fewer intolerant tourists this year. Yes, that'll do.

As for my thoughts on the selections... Having grown up in Edmonton until my early 20s, I can authoritatively say: "Huh?" Mind you, things have probably changed in the city's gay community, of which I knew pretty much nothing, having been closeted for the entire time. Plus, Edmonton still has the world's largest shopping mall. That's pretty gay, right?

So, congratulations to the cities that made the cut! And may all the ones that didn't have an absolutely traditional Friday the 13th.
