Can I get a "_ **whaaaa** __ **?!** _"

Stu Murray, the former leader of Manitoba's Conservative Party, has been appointed as CEO of the upcoming Canadian Human Rights Museum.

Murray, incidentally, [voted _against_ the provincial Charter Compliance Act](http://www.gov.mb.ca/hansard/house_biz/3rd-37th/votes_075.html "It's in Hansard, biatches!") in 2002, which amended 55 acts to give gay common-law spouses equal rights to their straight counterparts in full compliance with Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Hmm... I kind of figured that would put him in the museum, just not really in _this_ way.

The Human Rights Museum is a popular target for anti-gay groups, who [launch organized lobby efforts](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/02/lobby-group-blasts-museum/ "Slap never forgets!") to control its direction and content in order to exclude GLBT exhibits.
