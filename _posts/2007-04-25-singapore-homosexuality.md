Gay travelers may be in for a treat! Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's influential former prime minister, has been openly mulling why gayness is still illegal in his country:

> If in fact it is true, and I have asked doctors this, that you are genetically born a homosexual---because that's the nature of the genetic random transmission of genes---you can't help it. So why should we criminalize it?

Well, asking doctors may be a _teeny_ bit of an oversimplification, but actively pondering why gay people say their orientation is not a choice is probably a step in the right direction.

Incidentally, gay travelers are sometimes surprised by the anti-gay laws of popular travel destinations. While Singapore still has a pretty healthy gay scene, random arrests are possible and being gay is punishable by prison terms. To help educate travelers, the Canadian government has issued [warnings for gay vacationers](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/06/canada-warns-gay-travelers/ "A handy guide of where you won't be killed.").

And in the meantime... If you're a gay traveler disappointed by Singapore's current laws, here's some alternative destination advice: Afghanistan, while popular in the news, might not be the best second-choice.
