![Queers Against Llamas]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/03/queers-against-llamas.jpg' | relative_url}} "My one wish is that this sign actually appears at some point during the Toronto Pride parade.")

Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto, has announced that he will deny $100,000 in funding for this year's Pride Week celebrations---_unless_ the parade portion of the festival excludes a group called Queers Against Israeli Apartheid from marching.

For some time now, Toronto Pride has been entangled in a ridiculous controversy that I don't particularly care to understand. On one side, there appears to be people like Rob Ford, who feel privileged enough to decide which segments of the GLBT community can and cannot participate in their own parade; on the other side there's QAIA, who is using an event intended to be a celebration of GLBT culture, struggles, and achievements as a venue for an unrelated political message.

Such drama. Such dumb, dumb drama. Is there a side that doesn't deserve a slap?

Either way, now that I've officially touched this landmine, I believe I will start a new group: Queers Against Unrelated Issues And Douchey Mayors.
