![Say, Mark? How did you spend your evening? Oh, you know, the usual... sketching, inking, and painting a computer keyboard in three-point perspective before resizing it in such a way that you can barely see the joke.](/wp-content/media/2009/02/lifesite-keyboard.jpg "Say, Mark? How did you spend your evening?

A New York judge has ruled that the surviving partner of a same-sex couple married in Canada is entitled to the deceased's estate---as stipulated in his will---without having to involve next of kin in the probate proceedings. It's a barely interesting legal case for very many, terrifically boring reasons, but it does establish some precendent in how all the "death do us part" matters are handled when it comes to foreign same-sex marriages.

Say, let's see how those nutty scribes at LifeSite are reporting this!

> Despite the fact that same-sex "marriage" is illegal in New York, a New York Judge has ruled that a man will receive the estate of his deceased male partner, whom he had "wed" in Canada eight months earlier. [...] The decision is the latest in a series of decision [sic] in New York which have set legal precedent in the state in favor of same-sex "marriage."

We'll ignore, for a moment, that same-sex marrages are not actually illegal in New York when performed out-of-state, and focus on the much more interesting issue here: [Scare quotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes "They're scary, I guess")!

Yes, in their [usual LifeSite style](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/01/lifesite-hearts-scare-quotes/ "That alleged, so-called "), every occurance of the words "marriage," "married," "wed," and "spouse" in the article are encased by a pair of delightfully sneering quotations. Why, even the word "divorce" gets a nice pair of quotes when it refers to same-sex partners. In fact, of the exactly nine sentences, there are 13 pairs of quotation marks---none of which are used for proper attributions. Oh, how the contempt does drip forth! I can almost visualize the author's face, locked in a disapproving rictus, the Shift key permanently held for maximum quotage.

Almost makes you wonder exactly what their beef is regarding state probate notification procedures with respect to estate transfer between same-sex spouses...

Probably the same-sex part.

Parenthetically, while LifeSite correctly points out that the couple was married in Canada eight months ago, they somehow neglect to mention that the couple had been in a committed relationship for nearly 25 years prior and the surviving siblings had no objections to the will.
