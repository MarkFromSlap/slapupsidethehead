Conservative Party members gathered in fabulous Winnipeg last weekend for a policy convention that steered the party to the right on many social issues.

In accordance with efforts to make the party more mysterious and whimsical, much of the convention was closed to media and non-members. Still, some topics were open to all. Of relevance to gay Canadians, this included the adoption of policies to redundantly entrench already-existing rights of churches to not perform same-sex weddings,  to limit the investigative and adjudication powers of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, and to officially declare gay people as "icky."

While I think the church debate was just a silly wink to the party's grumpy, gay-obsessed base (it has no relevance beyond being another opportunity to take a verbal jab at gay people) the Tories ought to tread carefully on making reforms to the Human Rights Commission. The Commission, which was created to ensure employment and equal treatment with respect to lodging and services, is still [very much necessary](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/11/lesbian-couple-denied-basement-suite/ "Seriously; lodging rights are still in danger!?") for these purposes, especially for gay people.

The policy convention concluded with Stephen Harper dimming the lights, donning a top hat and cane, and waving the Conservative Power Orb into mesmerizing, interpretive light patterns to great applause.
