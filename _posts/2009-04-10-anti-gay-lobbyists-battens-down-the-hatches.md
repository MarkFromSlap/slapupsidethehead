Well, it's the Easter long weekend, so let's have some fun!

National Organization for Marriage, an anti-gay lobby group based in the United States, has released one of the wackiest anti-gay advertisements I've seen, comparing same-sex marriage to a violent storm. [YouTube has the goods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp76ly2_NoI "But come back afterwards, m'kay?").

The disparity in outlook has taken a turn for the melodramatic, has it not?

![The wind... It's so cold, it's sending shivers up my uvula.](/wp-content/media/2009/04/gay-storm-part-2.jpg "The wind... It's so cold, it's sending shivers up my uvula.")

![The gays want to blow us! (Away, that is...)](/wp-content/media/2009/04/gay-storm-part-3.jpg "The gays want to blow us! (Away, that is...)")

![The horror! Oh, the horror! It's so horrifically horrible!](/wp-content/media/2009/04/gay-storm-part-4.jpg "The horror! Oh, the horror! It's so horrifically horrible!")

![I do.](/wp-content/media/2009/04/gay-storm-part-5.jpg "I do.")

I'll leave the final bit of amusement courtesy of the [Human Rights Campaign](http://www.hrc.org/12470.htm "A great group with a great cause"), who has managed to get the [audition tapes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRjVDZxho54 "Each actor has their own take on it, too. How interesting!") for the spot---and, interestingly enough---every one of those concerned individuals is a California doctor and Massachusetts parent. Fascinating!

Anyway, thanks to everyone who sent this ad in. Have a great long weekend! Slap will be back on Wednesday instead of Monday. Cheers!
