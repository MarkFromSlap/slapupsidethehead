Well, it's Thanksgiving in Canada today, so I'm taking the day off. For those of you unfamiliar with Canadian Thanksgiving, or are only familiar with the rather unusual United States holiday of the same name, I've prepared some [Canadian Thanksgiving trivia from previous years](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/tag/thanksgiving/ "There will be a quiz later."). For the rest of us, as you enjoy your meal of boiled grouse and gaze upon the soft light from each of the three, traditional _bougies d'__écureuil faché_, be sure to stop and reflect on everything you have to be thankful for. I know I'll be thinking of all of you on the hour of thanks, 7 pm (7:30 pm NFLD).

Until Wednesday, Happy Thanksgiving!
