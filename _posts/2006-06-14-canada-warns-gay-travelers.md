Going somewhere exotic for vacation? Somewhere boring for business? Well, Canada's [Consular Affairs Bureau](http://www.voyage.gc.ca/ "For those who enjoy reading dry government sites") would like to have a quick word with you first! They've updated their travel information booklet, entitled _[Bon Voyage, But](http://www.voyage.gc.ca/main/pubs/bon_voyage_but-en.asp "It's a fun read. Well, not really...")_, and the new 2006/2007 edition contains some lovely new warnings for us gays!

What's the warning, you ask? Well, basically, if you're gay---and especially if you're married---_beware!_ Not only will most countries not recognize your marital status, but many will arrest or even _kill_ you. Why, even our friendly neighbours to the south will turn you away if you declare yourselves as married on your travel paperwork.

So if you're planning on going to [breathtaking Singapore](http://www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/report-en.asp?country=265000 "OK, scratch that one off the list..."), heed the government's new advice: "Homosexuality is illegal. Convicted offenders may face lengthy jail sentences and fines." And don't even think of going to [breathtaking Iran](http://www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/report-en.asp?country=132000 "It's so pretty this time of year, I'm told."), as you may be sentenced to lashing, a prison sentence, and/or death. Jinkies!

Personally, I appreciate the government's work, but I think I'll stick to regional travel for now... [Alberta Carriage Museum](http://www.remingtoncarriagemuseum.com/ "It was featured on The Simpsons, if that means anything..."), anyone?
