![Finally the interest rate of my savings account will go back to normal]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/04/economy-solved.jpg' | relative_url}} "Finally the interest rate of my savings account will go back to normal")

The province of Alberta has completely eliminated all forms of gender reassignment surgery from its public health care, cloaked as a cost-saving measure to improve the economy. The surgery, which was recommended to about twelve Albertans per year, can demonstrably improve the lives of transgendered individuals at virtually no cost to the health care system.

Already, the move has sparked outrage and confusion among the transgendered community, and has some MLAs---including a Conservative backbencher---seeking answers. The move seems a _tad_ ideological, considering the negligible cost of the services, and that the province only recently eliminated health care premiums at a cost of over a billion dollars.

Ontario had also tried de-listing gender re-assignment surgery from its public health care system, but was forced to re-introduce it by the Human Rights Commission ten years later.
