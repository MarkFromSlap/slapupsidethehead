![A man in the pose of The Thinker ponders to himself:]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/09/the-thinker.jpg' | relative_url}} "therefore I'm maybe?")

Linda Harvey, an anti-gay activist and lobbyist on behalf of Mission America, has announced that "there is no proof that there's ever anything like a gay, lesbian, or bisexual or transgendered child, or teen, or human."

"There are no such humans," she added.
