![A campaign ad for Parent's Voice, featuring a chiuaua with the slogan:]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/11/parents-voice-campaign.jpg' | relative_url}} "Although this image is deeply unfair to Chiauaus, which are no where near as annoying as Parent's Voice.")

Parent's Voice, the municipal political party whose [sole purpose](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/10/parents-start-new-party-against-school-anti-bullying-policies/ "Parents Start New Party Against School Anti-Bullying Policies") revolved around revoking the Burnaby District School Board's anti-homophobia and anti-bullying policy, has been soundly defeated.

Parent's Voice was a staunch opponent to the existing school board's policies acknowledging GLBT students---policies that demonstrably help reduce harassment and bullying that has historically led to suicide. Thankfully, voters instead re-elected the entire city council and school board who had introduced and stood by these important policies. The highest placing of all the Parent's Voice candidates, by contrast, came in tenth place.

This thorough rejection rather aptly demonstrates just how much of a minority these vocal opponents to equal rights and protections for GLBT people really are. Still, it's important not to dismiss their actions as inconsequential, so I wish to congratulate all the students and supporters that helped get people out to the polls and counter the sort of nonsense that Parent's Voice stood for.

Here's to Burnaby's much safer schools!
