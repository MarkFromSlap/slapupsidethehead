![Priest thinks to himself how super he is after driving away a young, enthusiastic, and faithful volunteer.](/wp-content/media/2010/08/dumb-church.jpg "Jesus was all about turning people away, right?")

Tory Inglis, a 17-year old gay teen from B.C., has withdrawn from her position as a church youth leader after being punished for volunteering as a Pride organizer.

The young lesbian appeared in a photo for a local newspaper reporting on a gay pride event in June, only to be summoned to a meeting with officials for the First Presbyterian Church a month later. There, the officials called the teen a poor role model, scolding her until she cried, and requested that she stop her volunteer work with the Pride group immediately.

Churches have a special status in Canada which entitles them to violate our Charter of Rights and Freedoms with respect to services and employment, so the Presbyterian Church is allowed to do behave this way, as immoral as it seems. That said, it's still an odd stance for this particular church. According to their own handbook on Social Action, the church says that it "does not limit the roles of its members on the basis of their sexual orientation."

Tory, meanwhile, was left with a conflicting message. "They want me to leave the Pride organization," she said, "even though it stands for all of the things they preach in church---which is acceptance of all people."

No worries, Tory. Anyone who volunteers so much of their time to such worthwhile causes is a super role model. Keep standing up for what's right, and you'll do just fine!
