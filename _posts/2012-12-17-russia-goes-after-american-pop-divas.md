Less than a year ago, the Russian city of St. Petersburg passed a law banning "homosexual propaganda," with expected hysterical results. From equal rights marches to rainbows on milk cartons, no one seems to be safe from the accusing eyes of the ruling United Russia party in their search for violators of their new law. Over 70 arrests and countless accusations have been made since the law's introduction, and, naturally, that applies to... visiting pop divas.

Last month, Madonna was the subject of a Russian court case accusing the singer of "traumatizing minors" by advocating for gay rights during a concert in August. While Madonna didn't attend or comment on the case, the plaintiffs sought 333 million rubles (about $10 million dollars) in damages, claiming that the singer's advocacy would cause the nation's birth rate to plummet and "erode the nation's defense capability by depriving the country of future soldiers."

The case was dismissed, mercifully. That hasn't stopped an appeal from being launched, however, and a new pop star has now been put in the bizarre law's cross hairs.

Lady Gaga has now been accused of promoting homosexual propaganda at the beginning of a concert last Wednesday. "We will contact the prosecutors and the law enforcement agencies to carry out a thorough investigation of the situation," Vitaly Milonov, the MP responsible for the anti-gay law, told the media.
