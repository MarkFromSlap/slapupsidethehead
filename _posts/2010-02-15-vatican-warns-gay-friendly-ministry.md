![]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/02/church-argument.jpg' | relative_url}} "It's all about self-flagellation, fasts, and silence!")

The Catholic Church has ordered New Ways Ministry, a religious group that welcomes gay and lesbian Catholics, to not speak about any gay-related subjects. Cardinal Francis George warned the group last week that they have "no approval or recognition from the Catholic Church."

The group has been at odds with the Vatican for 11 years, when they were first told that their "public statements on homosexuality contained ambiguities and errors."

Ambiguities and errors. Hey, that describes a bible that I grew up with pretty well. I wonder how that thing is doing these days? Staying relevant, I hope.
