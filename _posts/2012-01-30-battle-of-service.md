While legislators in New Hampshire [consider a bill](http://www.wmur.com/r/30285164/detail.html "Disgusting") that would make it legal for business owners in the public sector to deny services to any gay person getting married, an owner of an upscale bistro in Tennessee is doing almost the opposite---[refusing service to homophobic lawmakers](http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/jan/30/bistro-at-the-bijou-owner-boots-bans-state-sen/ "Tee hee!"). (Ah, the sting of their own discrimination... Think it'll change any minds?)
