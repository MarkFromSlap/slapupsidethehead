![Hateful Fliers For Campus Security](/wp-content/media/2007/12/hateful-fliers.jpg)

Campus police at the [University of Windsor](http://www.uwindsor.ca/ "That's Windsor Ontario, not Windsor Castle") have issued a security alert after several homophobic and racist messages were found across campus. While the content of the messages is a mystery, it was disturbing enough for the Office of the President to issue an open letter to the university community:

> There have been [incidents that] deeply concern us involving abusive language and intimidating behaviour towards gay students at the Faculty of Law. The University of Windsor is committed to fostering an inclusive campus [...] however, considerable progress must be made before we are able to realize such an environment.

What, no attempt at sugar-coating the university's progress on their vision of an diverse and tolerant campus? Why, that could only mean there's a delightfully ironic twist somewhere here!

Yes, it turns out that one of the racist incidents mentioned in the letter involved members of a campus social justice community committed to "diversity and equity and the education of future generations of young people."

I'd say the university's vision needs work.
