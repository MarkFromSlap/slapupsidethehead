Family Research Institute, an anti-gay lobby group based in the United States, has warned Americans that [advancements in equal rights for GLBT citizens has "doomed" Canada](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/family-research-institute-gay-rights-doomed-canada) forever. Funny... I don't feel particularly doomed today. I mean, once you get used to all the walking corpses wailing through rivers of fire along the streets, you'll wonder how you ever got along without them. A particularly roasty corpse returned some sunglasses I dropped today. His fingers were hot enough to melt the plastic frame a bit, but it was a kind gesture nonetheless.
