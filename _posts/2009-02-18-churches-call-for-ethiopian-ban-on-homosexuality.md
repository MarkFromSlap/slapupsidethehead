![It's a priority.](/wp-content/media/2009/02/ethiopian-priority.jpg "It's a priority.")

The Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant churches in Ethiopia have gathered to formally call on their government to enact a constitutional ban on homosexuality. Being gay is already illegal in Ethiopia with prison sentences of up to five years---but why settle for boring, old _illegal_ when it can be _constitutionally_ _illegal!_

An anonymous spokesperson for the church coalition spoke to journalists after their meeting to explain:

> For [gays] to act in this manner they have to be dumb, stupid like animals. We strongly condemn this behaviour; they have to be disciplined and their acts discriminated---they have to be taught a lesson.

Yes, having solved all those pesky, dire famine and plague issues, Ethiopia's churches are finally moving onto other priorities---and what better way to start than to judge and punish all those dumb, dumb gays that are holding back the country?

You stay relevant, you Ethiopian church coalition, you!
