Looks like Toronto's got another annual event coinciding with Pride Week: A city councillor has proposed---_once again_---that [funding for the city's annual Pride festival be withheld](http://www.xtra.ca/public/Toronto/Pride_doesnt_qualify_for_city_money_says_councillor-12048.aspx) until it can be confirmed that a group called Queers Against Israeli Apartheid does not participate in the parade portion of the weeklong event. Perhaps we can also withhold Toronto councillors' salary until it can be independently confirmed that they are not, in fact, giant douches.
