![Gay cartoons are coming to brainwash Russian children!](/wp-content/media/2008/03/gay-cartoon-attack1.jpg "Gay Cartoons Attack")

Christian and Muslim groups in Russia are demanding the shutdown of 2X2, a cartoon television network, because it airs programs that "promote homosexuality."

The groups have formed a lobby coalition called _the Consultive Council of the Heads of the Protestant Churches in Russia_. They've singled out _South Park_ as a particularly offensive program and called for the government to strip the television station of its license:

> Through the use of cartoons this channel is pumping, day and night, an ideology into the consiousness of minors of perversion and other vices.

Yekaterina Doglosheveva, a spokesperson for 2X2, said their station's target audience is 16-30 year old men---not children---and that Russia is a secular state. He asked where the line would be drawn:

> The atheists could have just as well written a letter to demand that all religious channels and programs be closed. We work respecting the constitution, we do not violate the law.

A good stance---although, the council may have a point. I've watched The Simpsons for years and turned out completely gay!
