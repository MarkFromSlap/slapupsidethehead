A crowd of about 200 appeared in Queen's Park, Ontario yesterday, protesting provincial legislation that will help eliminate anti-gay bullying in schools. This rally also marked the unveiling of some brand new terminology to be used by the anti-gay lobby, as a spokesperson began referring to Gay-Straight Alliances as "[homosexual sex clubs](http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Two_antibullying_bills_spark_protests_at_Queens_Park-11766.aspx)." The protesters then unexpectedly switched topics to rally against school-time "kidnapping, murder, and treason gangs," previously known as _chess clubs_.
