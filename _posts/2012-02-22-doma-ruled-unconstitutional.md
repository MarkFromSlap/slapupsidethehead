A US federal court has ruled that the country's Defense of Marriage Act---a law forbidding any federal recognition of same-sex relationships---[is unconstitutional](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/02/defense-of-marriage-act-unconstitutional-federal-judge-rules-in-california-case.html "A little late, but welcome!"). Judge Jeffrey White, a Bush appointee, issued the ruling today on the basis that DOMA violates the constitution's guarantees of equality. Congratulations, Americans: Your backwards prejudices are shedding faster than a traumatized mutt in July! _(January in the southern hemisphere.)_
