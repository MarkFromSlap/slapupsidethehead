Well, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Numerous gay couples and athletes attending the [1<sup>st</sup> World Outgames](http://www.montreal2006.org/ "Think of it as the gay olympics...") in Montr√©al this month have chosen to wed while they're here!

Canada is, of course, only one of four countries with equal marriage rights, and this gives Outgame participants the perfect opportunity to get a real wedding. (You know, none of that "civil union" nonsense.) In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some couples even seek refugee status from their home(ophobic) countries while here. (I hear it's all the rage [in India](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/06/the-fake-gay-influx/ "Would anyone actually take advantage of Canada's tolerance? Naaaahhh..."), after all.)

So, to all the soon-to-be-wedded couples, congratulations! I'm sure you'll be very happy together with proper recognition! Uh, provided our new conservative government will [issue you your visas](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/visa-delays/ "Conservative homo-bigotry at it's most bigotty.")...
