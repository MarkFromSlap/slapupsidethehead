![Catholic Counselling Centre]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/10/gays_meet.jpg' | relative_url}})

A counseling centre providing meeting space for gay rights organisations? _What is the world coming to?!_

The obsessively anti-gay lobby group Defend Traditional Marriage And Family publicly denounced the Catholic Family Counseling Centre, which has been providing space to the equal rights organisation [Tri-Pride](http://www.tri-pride.ca/ "It's, like, three Prides in one!") for over three years, for "going against the teachings of the church."

A spokeswoman for the CFCC responded with shock, reminding the anti-gay lobby that the counseling centre is a **non-denominational** , inclusive facility, and that the word "Catholic" appears in the agency's name simply to honour the priest that founded it. She then re-assured Tri-Pride that they will continue to be welcomed at the centre's facilities.

Of course the anti-gay group started furiously backpedalling, ranting about some sort of semantic responsibility with the word "Catholic." And why not? I mean, ignore for a moment that gay people can be devout Catholics too. Couldn't you understand the confusion---even though the [CFCC's website](http://www.cfcchelps.ca/ "Open and gay friendly, of course.") mentions that it is a non-denominational agency in capitalized, boldfaced letters as its **first sentence**? After all, "non-denominational" is a _very_ big word, and flipping through a dictionary can be... Well, you know how those "pro-family" types are when it comes to depth of research.
