A study of over 400 gay and bisexual men by the University of Minnesota has shown that internalized homophobia, and not simply being gay, leads to poor mental and sexual health.

Results are to be published in the esteemed medical journal, _Dr. Obvious' Journal of Obviously Obvious Obviousness_.

Still, the study is actually pretty important because it runs counter to the claims of anti-gay lobby groups who repeatedly assert that gay people are somehow inherently miserable---spotlighting some ill-defined (but always destructive) lifestyle that all gay people are supposed to share. As an actual gay person, I can say that's just nutty; so, while my official reaction to this study is an enthusiastic "_well, duh_", it is kind of nice that someone went through the menial task of putting it on the record. And put in such a blunt way, as Dr. Simon Rosser, one of the researchers, demonstrates:

> Given the debates in many religious denominations about homosexuality, and in society about homosexuals and civil rights, [this research] is also timely. In particular, the old advice to gay men to fight, deny, or minimize their homosexuality likely only increases depression, greater isolation, and poorer sexual health.

So, there you have it. Love yourself for who you are, and you'll be better off for it. And, as a small aside, why not start with some delicious [gay pasta](http://www.mcgilldaily.com/article/4455-friends-with-food-how-to "With seashells and bowties and leprechauns!"), courtesy of the McGill Daily?[
