_A National Marriage Circus!_ Sounds like fun! I _can't wait_ to see all the clowns and animals... Oh---wait, no. I misread something...

The anti-gay lobby conglomerate, Defend Marriage Coalition, held their long-planned "National Marriage _Caucus_" on Parliament Hill yesterday, and boy, was it one long day of gay-despising fun! There were clowns and animals and... Yes, I know it says "caucus."

The lobbyists started the day off with some anti-gay press releases, followed by some scheduled one-on-one anti-gay time with MPs to exchange delightful bits of oft-repeated, Pro-Family Approvedâ„¢ demagoguery. This included:

- Holy Crap! Our religious freedoms have been revoked!
- Man Alive! Gay marriage was, like, forced through! Was there even a debate?
- Great Caesar's Ghost! Don't you care about children's rights?!
- Sweet, Merciful Manta Ray! My own marriage has been destroyed!
- Heavenly Carton Of Fancy Molasses! My family turned gay and burst into flames!
- Holy Floating Wad Of Fluff! For The Love Of All The Soil In The Ecosystem! Heaven Shining Upon The... Actually---I think that was the gist of it.

So what does this near-prohibitively expensive day of lobbying mean for us Canadians? I guess we'll just have to curl up in the corner and wait nervously until that fateful day in December when parliament gathers to---ooh! My pumpkin cookies are ready!
