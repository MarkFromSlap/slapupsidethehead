Reverend Shawn Sanford Beck, a priest in Saskatoon, has resigned his position after refusing to renounce same-sex marriage. Beck, who had his license stripped in January, was given a temporary license and an ultimatum by Bishop Rodney Andrews back in March: Either stop supporting equal rights for gays, or get lost.

Well, it looks like Beck has bravely chosen the latter. (Though he made his intention clear [quite some time ago](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/03/another-priest-fired/ "Yeah, it was pretty much the same illustration").) In an open letter, he called the church's position on same-sex marriage "theologically problematic and fundamentally unjust."

And, with that, I'm officially out of ideas on how to illustrate priests being kicked out by their churches. If you've got an idea for the next one, send your suggestions to:
