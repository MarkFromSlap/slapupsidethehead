So how far can hysterical anti-gayness get you in a race for Alberta's premier? Well, pretty far, actually!

[Ted Morton](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/ted-morton-destractor/ "Lookout! Behind you!") came in a close second in the latest vote, confirming my suspicions that Mountain Standard Time is actually several decades in the past.

Frontrunner Jim Dinning, while still pretty darn anti-gay, resembles a mixture of [Snagglepuss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snagglepuss "Also known as Alcibiade, I'm told") and [Charles Nelson Reilly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nelson_Reilly "So blankin' blank that he makes me look straight.") in comparison to Morton, whose unnatural affinity for [anti-gay laws](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/morton-take-a-hint/ "Brains... BRAINS!") has earned him the title of "Da Man," put to the tune of a SUV-dealership jingle. I'm [not kidding](http://www.tedmorton.ca/upload/multi_audio/TedMortonIsTheMan.mp3 "Warning: Terrible, Terrible Nastiness Ahead").

The next (and hopefully final) vote is on December 2.

So, could there be an upside to a Morton-led province? Well, like I've always said---if you can't be a shining inspiration, a horrible warning is just as effective.
