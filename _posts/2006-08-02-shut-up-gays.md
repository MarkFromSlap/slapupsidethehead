![Retroactive Slap](/wp-content/media/2006/07/retroactive.jpg)Time for another retroactive slap! (And, if you're wondering about these; I should mention that I'm actually moving 4,000 km across the country. That's why [Rob Anders](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/homosexual-sex-marriage/ "You remember, the homosexual sex marriage guy!") is now officially my _former_ MP; wouldn't you have moved, too?)

Elsie Wayne, although now the leader of an anti-gay lobby group, Traditional Marriage Crusade (_chortle_), is best known for her delightfully insane outburst in the **House of Commons** back when she was a conservative MP. Keep in mind, this quote is actually from **the House** , not from some insane fringe group press release:

> Why do [gays] have to be out here in the public, always debating that they want to call it marriage? Why are they in parades? Why are men dressed up as women on floats? **If they are going to live together, go live together and shut up about it!**

Now, place your bets, everyone! Are her views as old as her, or vice versa?
