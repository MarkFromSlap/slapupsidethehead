The Canadian military has hinted that it will [stop funding gender reassignment surgery](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/04/27/defence-viagra-transgender.html) in its health care package as a cost-saving measure. Yeah, because _that's_ the spending problem we've got in the military;  not, say, [some other $25-billion spending plans](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1171155--royal-canadian-air-force-still-wants-f-35-fighter-jet-committee-hears) currently under consideration.
