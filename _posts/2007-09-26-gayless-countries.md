![Road Slap]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/09/road-slap.jpg' | relative_url}})

Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, visited Columbia University on Monday. When pressed by a student about Iran's treatment of gays, Ahmadinejad had this to say:

> In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country. In Iran we do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who's told you that we have this.

While the comment elicited derisive laughter from the audience, I found the words chilling. Iran [executes homosexuals](http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/11/21/iran12072.htm "Disgusting."). A television report produced by the CBC in February [detailed a few of the stories](http://www.cbc.ca/sunday/2007/03/030407_1.html "A must-see") coming out of Iran, and the horror is unimaginable.

Iran isn't the only country to persecute gays by law and then deny they exist, either. When Canada's own [Coalition gaie et lesbienne du Qu√©bec](http://www.cglq.org/ "I'd translate this, but I'm lazy.") first attempted to gain Observer Status at the UN so they could officially report on human rights attrocities around the world, Egypt [voted against admittance](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/un-rejects-gays/ "Egypt decides that no countries care about gays"), saying they "don't have a gay problem in [Egypt] because there are no gays there." Egypt [actively entraps and tortures homosexuals](http://hrw.org/reports/2004/egypt0304/ "Disgusting.").

Really, one only needs to look at [traveler warnings](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/06/canada-warns-gay-travelers/ "The world is a big and scary place") to see the extent of persecution faced by gays worldwide. Misinformation and denial about homosexuality is widespread and troublesome, and this is reflected in the cruel laws of many countries.

Remedying this won't be easy. Given Canada's own denial of the dangers faced by [gay refugees](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/09/gay-refugee-speaks/ "We're not exactly hospitable either"), a local start isn't too far back.
