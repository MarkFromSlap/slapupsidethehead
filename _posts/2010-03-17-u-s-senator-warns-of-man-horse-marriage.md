J.D. Hayworth, Senator John McCain's primary challenger in the United State's upcoming senate elections, is trying to ban same-sex marriage nationwide. Rather than offering any reasons why gay marriage is bad (they are awfully hard to come by, after all), he had this explanation:

> You see, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, when it started this move toward same-sex marriage, actually defined marriage---now get this---it defined marriage as simply "the establishment of intimacy." [...] I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse. It's just the wrong way to go, and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support.

Quirky!

Hayworth is essentially declaring that if marriage is all about love, then it is impossible to legally deny marrying other "lovable" things---like horses.

The problem here---as if such an argument deserves any dissection---is that marriages aren't one-way; they involve two people that love each other. Does a horse have the capacity to consent to such a partnership? Can it sign the necessary state documents? Can it uphold its legal responsibilities involving property, decision-making, taxes, etcetera?

The answer, of course, is neigh.

And with that, have a great Wednesday, kids!
