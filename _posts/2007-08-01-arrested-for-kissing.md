Two gay men were arrested in Rome after they shared a kiss outside the Colosseum. Gay rights organizations are now protesting the incident by holding a mass "protest kiss" at the same location, August 2<sup>nd</sup>.

Cool idea; it reminds me of something I saw painted on old pottery the last time I was in Rome.
