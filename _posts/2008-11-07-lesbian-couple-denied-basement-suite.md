A lesbian couple in British Columbia have filed a human rights complaint after being denied a basement suite.

College students Kathleen Webb and Liana LeBlanc say that Brenda and Marc Rovner, owners of a basement suite for rental, had assured them they were the first choice of tenants and that the suite was theirs until it was revealed they were lesbians. If that's true, it will be a violation of the Human Rights Code, and possibly even Canadian law.

In a request to have the case dismissed, the Rovners provided a sworn affidavit claiming that their suite was only big enough for one tenant, contradicting the existence of their previous pair of tenants. But, who knows? It might be shown that the last couple was really just one person who could astroproject and felt like pretending to be a pair in a grand scheme to pay more rent.

Either way, I'll report on the actual findings when they are released, likely in 2019.
