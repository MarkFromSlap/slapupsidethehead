The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal has agreed to hear a case from a lesbian couple who claims they were refused a house because they're gay. Although the couple had signed an offer for the property, they say that the seller, Alexander Berry, backed out once he discovered they were lesbians. Berry said he didn't know the two women were a couple and changed his mind because of the short time limit on their agreement. The property was sold to a young family two days after the gay couple had signed the offer.

While the case isn't scheduled to be heard until the 15th, Berry tried to get the complaint dismissed, arguing that he didn't fall under B.C. human rights jurisdictions because he's Albertan. The tribunal rejected his request.

So, knowing how these things normally work, I think we can expect a decision to come as early as November, 2014.
