![How to Not Hold a Protest](/wp-content/media/2006/05/not_a_protest.jpg)

The not-so-influential lobby group, ~~Attack Gay Marriage~~ , uh, "Defend Traditional Marriage," was protesting outside governement offices in Ontario last week---or so it would look _at first glance_. When asked about the protest, spokesperson Jack Fonseca responded "This is **not** a protest." Instead, he indicated that it was a "positive rally."

The protes---oops... _positive rally_ included a handful of people carrying megaphones and signs with phrases like "Notwithstanding Clause: Use it, Mr. Harper," referring to the never-before-used-in-federal-politics clause that can [make otherwise unconstitutional laws legal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notwithstanding_clause "Why is this in the constitution, again?") for a period of 5 years. The pr---ositive rallyers want the clause used so they can ban same-sex marriage in Canada without facing constitutional challanges. Yeah, that's being positive...

Now, pardon me a moment. My neighbours above seem to have stopped defending the tranquility of soundlessness. Just listen to them walking around like that! They need to be more pro-quiescent; I'm going to rally for their support.
