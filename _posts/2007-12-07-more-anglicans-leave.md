Two more parishes have split from the Canadian Anglican Church over same-sex blessings. The churches will now serve under an orthodox Argentinian archibishop who wholeheartedly opposes blessings for gay couples.

Reverend Archie Pell, a member of one of the breakaway congregations, was ecstatic over the move:

> We are thrilled to be embraced by a God-fearing Province that allows us to remain fully Anglican and fully in communion with the worldwide Anglican Church. We no longer have to feel alone.

Alone... You mean like the gay people of faith who no longer have a place at your parish, Reverend?
