A public elementary school in King City, Ontario has cancelled "opposite gender day" over concerns that it would result in gender identity issues or turn the students gay.

The day was proposed by the elementary school's student council as a fun idea where kids could dress up as the opposite gender, if they wanted to. However, opponents, including Charles McVety---head of Canada's largest anti-gay lobby group, the Canada Family Action Coalition---were infuriated with the concept.

"If this was so innocent, then why did the principal not stop this right away?" McVety asked the press rhetorically. "This was part of a greater agenda to teach gender identity and to confuse our children at a young age, and to tell them they can't be truly happy until they discover their inner identity."

In reality, this "greater agenda" was the idea of elementary school students, including Ripley Antonacci, an eighth grader and president of the student council. "We just wanted to have a fun day and came up with the idea," he told a reporter. "A lot of people do it for Halloween and we just thought it would be a cool idea."

"We didn't mean to offend anyone," he added apologetically. "I was a little confused because I didn't know why people would say those things."

And that's how the kids at King City Public School were taught that taking a lighthearted look at gender roles, even in the context of a fun dress-up day,  is never acceptable.
