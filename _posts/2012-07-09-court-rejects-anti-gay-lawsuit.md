![Lady justice punches a man in the face:]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/07/justice.jpg' | relative_url}} "Lady justice has got an attitude.")

An anti-gay group calling themselves New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms filed a lawsuit late last year to reverse the state's equal marriage law. Like most attempts to get same-sex marriage overturned, they gave themselves a delightfully ironic name;  unlike other groups, however, they didn't seem to rely on the usual arguments about how families would be instantly vaporized or how children would now be used for cattle feed, etc. Instead they suggested that same-sex marriage is invalid in New York because two meetings of the Republican Senate's majority should have been held in public instead of privately leading up to the vote.

The case was rejected almost immediately in November, but New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms appealed to the state supreme court. On Friday, that court unanimously found that private meetings are perfectly allowable, adding that even if they weren't, it has _nothing to do with why same-sex marriage should be banned in any fathomable capacity_.

Well, that should have gone without saying.

Seriously, anti-gay lobbyists? Your arguments have always been deeply flawed, but this one isn't even fun. How am I supposed to get new material for this site when you're not mischaracterizing gay people in amusing ways anymore? Your next lawsuit had better involve accusations of conspiracy to release genetically engineered vampire pigeons, repurposed to inject schoolchildren with experimental gaydar genes or something. That just sounds a lot more fun to draw than someone following bureaucratic procedure improperly, you see.
