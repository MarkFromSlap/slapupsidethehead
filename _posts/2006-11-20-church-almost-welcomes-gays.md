A group of U.S. Catholic bishops decided last week that the Church ought to be more accepting of gay people. In fact, after lengthy deliberation, they've officially adopted new guidelines acknowledging that gay people do not choose their orientation and should therefore receive communion! Well, with some provisions, of course. If you have sex, try to marry your partner, or tell anyone you're gay, then there's **no communion for you!**

So, there you have it. The Church's definition of gay is now "total closet case." I guess that's still better than their old definition: "Spawn of evil incarnate."
