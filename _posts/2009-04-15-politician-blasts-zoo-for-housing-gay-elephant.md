Michal Grzes, a conservative politician in western Poland, has publicly spoken out against his local zoo for acquiring Ninio, a ten-year-old elephant that has only shown interest in other male companions.

No longer content with moralizing individuals of his own species, Grzes called Ninio complete waste of money:

> We didn't pay 37 million zlotys (about 14 million Canadian) for the largest elephant house in Europe to have a gay elephant live there.

A spokesperson for the zoo said that elephants don't normally reach sexual maturity until the age of 14, and so he still may not have discovered his sexual orientation.

Opponents are reportedly praying to help stop Ninio's recruitment of child zoo patrons into the sinful elephant lifestyle.
