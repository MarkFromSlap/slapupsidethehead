Anyone got a golf score clicker I can use?

An Anglican priest in Saskatoon will have his minister's license stripped for **not** refusing to perform same-sex marriages. Reverend Shawn Sanford Beck said he'd rather be dismissed than go against his conscience:

> [Denying same-sex marriages] goes against everything else I'm about in my ministry and everything else that the church stands for. I'm trying to send a very strong message to the gay and lesbian community, and to other communities that have been alienated from the church, that we don't all think the same and there are people willing to go to the wall.

While I commend Reverend Beck for his stand, his ejection doesn't surprise me considering the Anglican Church is willing to [shut down entire congregations](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/church-threatened-shutdown/ "No church for anybody!") and [punish retired Archbishops](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/church-suspends-archibishop/ "Even a lifetime of service won't excuse compassion") over their pro-gay stance. Of course, the Catholic church is also quite happy to [fire priests](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/priest-removed/ "For not firing someone gay, no less"), [deny communion to elderly volunteers](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/12/church-refuses-communion/ "No wafer for you!") and [rescind charity money over gay speakers](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/church-rescinds-peace-funding/ "The church shan't support something as unholy as peace").

This judgment is apparently called the "What Would Jesus Do?" approach.

Incidentally, in addition to losing his minister's license, Reverend Beck will no longer be able to continue working for a Lutheran inner-city project. Yep, that'll teach him to treat gay people as ordinary human beings!
