![Gwen Landolt Apology](/wp-content/media/2007/04/gwen-landolt-apology.jpg)

I wonder what Gwen Landolt is up to these days. As you may know, Gwen is the spokeswoman for REAL Women of Canada, a delightfully persistent anti-gay lobby group formed in the early 80s. And since same-sex marriage is settled and here to stay, she must have moved on to something else, right?

Wait---no, no. I must've spoken too soon. It looks like she's penned a formal apology to **the world** , on behalf of Canadians, for the same-sex marriage legislation. Observe our moment of quiet humility:

> [We] apologize to the people of the world for harm done through Canada's legalization of homosexual marriage. We are grieved and troubled as we consider the impact this is having in weakening the fundamental institution of marriage in countries and cultures around the world. [...]
> 
> Our warning to you, the people of the world, is to learn from our mistakes and avoid repeating them in your own countries. Forewarned should be forearmed.

Such passion... As one of the people of the world, I assure you: a tear has been shed. The effects of same-sex marriage must've been [_far_ more perilous](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/12/disastrous-consequences/ "The direness of it all!") than just letting guys like me wed. (_sniff._)

Oh well.

Hey, do you think this apology means REAL Women has given up its hysterical anti-gay lobbying efforts? Why, it hasn't even been four years since equal marriage blew up all of Canada's families and ensured the systemic collapse of society. (Or so I've been told.) I mean, if Gwen---and all the other lobbyists---quit, who will be left to feature on this site?
