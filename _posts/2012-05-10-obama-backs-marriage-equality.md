Barack Obama [announced his personal support of marriage equality yesterday](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/05/10/obama-same-sex-thurs.html), making him the first U.S. president to do so. Political analysts are already speculating on how this will affect November's elections, although I don't really expect that rabidly anti-gay voters would have supported Obama anyway. Still, in the off chance that you Americans don't re-elect Obama, what do you think of a friendly trade? You can send Obama up here, and in exchange you guys can have Stephen Harper. He's always wanted to be a U.S. president, you know.
