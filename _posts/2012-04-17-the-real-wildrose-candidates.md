Danielle Smith, the leader of Alberta's Wildrose Party, says she's in support of same-sex marriage (an odd thing to say, since that's already the law and provincial politicians don't have the legal authority to change it), but she clearly isn't speaking for her candidates. Allan Hunsperger, who is currently running for Wildrose, [penned a lengthy article in June](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/albertavotes2012/story/2012/04/15/albertavotes2012-wildrose-candidate-lake-of-fire.html) describing how gay people will "suffer the rest of eternity in the lake of fire." Just another friendly threat of unending torture from your future legislators, I guess!
