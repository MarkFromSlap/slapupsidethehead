I love mayors. They're inherently funny, like the head of a condo association---passionately seizing what amounts to no real power. And aren't we in luck? There are two mayor stories today!

Bill Mills, the mayor of Truru, Nova Scotia (who you may remember for some [earlier anti-gay shenanigans](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/ "One of my favourite posts, actually.")), is facing extra accusations of homophobia after declaring that gay men alone are responsible for a proposal to install a locked gate at Victoria Park, restricting hours for all residents. Many people are angry with the proposal, and while the park has a reputation of being shady (pun kind of intended), it has many problems, including drug dealers, underage drinking, and teenage hookups---not just gay cruising. Still, Mayor Mills has refused to withdraw or clarify his comments. The rest of the city council, meanwhile, has publicly distanced themselves from the mayor's craziness.

In some better mayor-related news, our friends in Houston, Texas have reason to celebrate after electing their very first lesbian mayor! Annise Parker, an openly gay politician with a partner of 16 years and two adopted children, won with 53.6 percent of the vote in the normally Ã¼ber-conservative U.S. state. The voter turnout was one of the lowest in history, mind you, at just over 16 percent. But that's just more proof that mayors are silly positions. Am I right?
