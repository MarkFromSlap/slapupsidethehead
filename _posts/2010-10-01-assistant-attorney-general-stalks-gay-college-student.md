[![Play Insanity: A clip of an Anderson Cooper interview with Andrew Shirvell](/wp-content/media/2010/10/play-insanity.jpg "You gotta see this, seriously.")](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwObjKZg9Jw)

Andrew Shirvell, an assistant Attorney General in the U.S. state of Michigan, has started a bizarre, one-man crusade against a gay college student.

In what can only be described as a complete obsession, Shirvell regularly downloads and quotes material from the student's Facebook content, as well as that of all his friends and family; he started a website devoted to denigrating the student, publishing offensively doctored photos and insults; he regularly pickets and videotapes the student, even outside his private home.

The target of Shirvell's _baffling_ obsession is Chris Armstrong, the elected student body president of the University of Michigan, who also happens to be gay. That doesn't mesh well with the anti-gay Shirvell, who is completely clueless as to how strange his behaviour is.

Seriously, this guy is totally nuts. Don't take my word for it, though; he recently agreed to an [interview on CNN with Anderson Cooper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwObjKZg9Jw "It's crazier than a clown-dressed squirrel eating a durian while parachuting."). Go check it out. I'll wait.

All done? Wow, eh?

I'd suggest that someone start a Andrew Shirvell Watch, but frankly Andrew Shirvell is already doing a pretty bang-up job at documenting the certifiably _insane_ creepiness of Andrew Shirvell.
