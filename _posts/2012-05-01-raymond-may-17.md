Slap reader Jen writes in with a really great fundraiser idea in memory of Raymond Taavel: _"I'm a displaced Haligonian in Toronto, and am organizing what I am hoping will end up being a Canada-wide initiative. I'm also an avid crossfitter, so I've planned a [tribute workout for raymond](http://www.raymondmay17.com/), on May 17th (the International Day Aganinst Homophobia and Transphobia). It's a fundraiser for the Youth Project in halifax---they do the kind of work to help create the kind of world Raymond imagined."_

Great idea, Jen! If anyone is interested in helping raise some money for a worthy cause, and potentially win some nifty prizes in the process, [check out the event website](http://www.raymondmay17.com/)!
