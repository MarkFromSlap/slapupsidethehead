Goodness knows why, but anti-gay lobbyists and the new conservative government are now trying their hardest to scrap The Court Challenge program. The program, run by the [oft-attacked](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/gay-film-festival/ "What do these groups have against heritage, anyway?") [Heritage department](http://www.pch.gc.ca/ "It's full of heritagey goodness"), was set up to help fund groups that wish to challenge potentially unconstitutional laws. It has been awarded in the past to several minority representation groups, such as [EGALE](http://www.egale.ca/ "I've linked to them before, I'll link to them again") (Equality for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere), aboriginal groups, groups for persons with disabilities, and [LEAF](http://www.leaf.ca/ "Equality for Women, can you imagine?") (The Women's Legal Education and Action Fund).

Gwen Landolt, representative for the anti-gay group REAL Women of Canada was practically foaming at the mouth that anyone would _dare_ challenge the fairness of a law:

> [The Court Challenge program] is a boondoggle for special-interest groups with a certain ideological perspective. Only one side of the argument gets the money.

Uh, no, Gwen. _Any_ group can get the money, but it has to be used to challenge _unconstitutional_ laws. You know, the kind that you're always pushing for? Why, even you'd be able to use it, if there were a law against hysterical right-wing social conservative groups using the word "boondoggle." Which there isn't.

Gwen, along with (anti) Justice Minister Extraordinare, [Vic Toews](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/justice-the-vic-toews-way/ "Look in the sky! It's a bird, it's a bigot, it's..."), also said the program should be reviewed because it's _shrouded in secrecy_ (ooooo). In reality, the details of how much funding is allocated to which group is not disclosed because of a law protecting solicitor-client confidentiality.

Thankfully, the [Canadian Bar Association](http://www.cba.org/ "No, they're not bartenders.") (who _actually_ studies law for a living) defended the program, saying it plays "a vital role in increasing access to justice for marginalized and vulnerable groups." Good stuff.
