![Slippery Slope](/wp-content/media/2006/10/slippery_slope.jpg)

The Anglican Church has suspended a retired Archibishop for blessing a same-sex couple at their wedding. Although the wedding took place in a non-Anglican church and the marriage certificate was signed by a different, non-Anglican minister, Archibishop Terrence Finlay was suspended for officiating over Mary Rowe and Sandra Morris, his longtime friends.

Gee, from what all the anti-gay groups were saying earlier, I thought same-sex marriage was supposed to be a _terrifying_ slippery slope---forcing priests to marry gay couples left-and-right. Who'd have thunk that it's the priests who'd be forced to refuse their blessings?

And just think! If we get that new [Defence of Religions act](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/tories-acting-scary/ "aka the Religions Trump Human Rights Act") that Justice Minister [Vic Toews](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/justice-the-vic-toews-way/ "With his own brand of unique, juicy justice!") promised (because religions are having _such_ a hard time), then a Justice of the Peace or civil marriage commissioner can refuse their officiation, too!

_Whoops!_ Watch your step here, folks; it's icy!
