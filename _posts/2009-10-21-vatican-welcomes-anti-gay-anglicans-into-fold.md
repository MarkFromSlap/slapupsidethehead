As far as religions go, I suppose you could do worse than the Anglicans. They at least entertain discussions about how to best integrate their doctrine with reality. They bless gay couples, for example, and extend to them the same dignities as any other parishioner---including eligibility for ordination.

Of course, all this love and tolerance doesn't sit too well with churchgoers who miss the unity that only old-fashioned judgment and condemnation can bring. Priests and bishops [have split](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/11/bishop-leaves-canada/ "Just as Jesus taught."), some [have been fired](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/10/another-priest-suspended-for-performing-same-sex-wedding/ "Just as Jesus taught."), the locks on church doors [have been changed](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/04/whats-up-with-the-anglicans/ "Just as Jesus taught.") to keep out congregations with differing perspectives---they've even started [suing each other](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/05/anglicans-go-to-court-over-same-sex-blessings/ "Just as Jesus taught."). Yet, all this kicking and moaning hasn't stopped the church from trying to stay as relevant as it can. What are bitter coots to do?

Well, the Vatican has a proposal: Join the Catholic Church! Be as rabidly anti-gay as you like! Heck, they'll even overlook the events that caused the Anglicans to split from Catholicism in the first place (it was a disagreement over King Henry VIII's denied divorce in 1534, for what it's worth) and recognize differing Anglican traditions by creating a new legal entity.

Aw, isn't that just the most adorablest thing ever? There's just nothing like a common dislike of us gays to mend a **475 year old** religious rift.
