![The old gay panic is put through the rounds by swapping the scenario. A gay guy punches a girl who was hitting on him.]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/08/gay-panic.jpg' | relative_url}} "Straight Panic!!!")

Shawn Woodward, a 37 year old man from Vancouver, was found guilty of aggravated assault this week after sucker-punching a 62-year-old gay man. Richard Dowrey, the victim, was left with permanent brain damage and will now require assistance for the rest of his life.

Woodward, who is straight, claimed that the punch was made in self-defense because Dowrey had made "unwanted sexual advances." Now, that's a pretty crazy argument on its own, but it's extra absurd in this case. The assault happened inside the Fountainhead Pub, a gay bar in the middle of Vancouver's gay district.

After examining witness testimony, the judge found that Woodward's evidence was not credible, that no sexual assault took place, and that Woodward merely became offended and violent after being hit on by a gay guy.

Sentencing happens in September, where it will be decided if the assault was also a hate crime.
