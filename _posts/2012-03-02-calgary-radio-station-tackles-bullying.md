Kool 105.5, a Calgary-based radio station, is tackling bullying with a [pretty novel incentive: A contest](http://www.kool1015.ca/Contests/ContestDetails.asp?ContestID=542 "Whoever doesn't bully anyone the most gets a prize?"). The school that signs the most pledges [asserting](http://www.kool1015.ca/downloadable-files/Anti-Bullying-Pledge.pdf "Here's the pledge form") that everyone has "the right to feel safe, respected, valued, and accepted" will get a free concert performed during school hours. Of course, if anyone breaks the pledge, all memory of the concert will be surgically removed by a brain specialist.
