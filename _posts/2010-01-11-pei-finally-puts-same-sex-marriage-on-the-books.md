Prince Edward Island finally updated their lawbooks over the holidays in recognition of same-sex couples for 29 pieces of legislation. While same-sex marriages have been legal in the province since federal law changed in 2006, spouses were still referred to as "husband and wife" and "man and woman" in provincial documents and laws until now.

There was no reason given for the nearly four year delay, but the change means that vital statistics, birth certificates, and other provincial documents and departments will now have accurate data.

Well, I'm glad to see you've joined the rest of the country, Island! (I can call you Island for short, right?)
