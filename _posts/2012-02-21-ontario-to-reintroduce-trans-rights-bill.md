A bill protecting the trans community from employment and housing discrimination in Ontario is [expected to be introduced](http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Trans_rights_bill_to_be_reintroduced_in_Ontario-11551.aspx) in the provincial legislature today. This will be the fourth time the bill has been introduced, but its odds are actually looking pretty good this time around. You know what they say: Fourth time's even charmier!
