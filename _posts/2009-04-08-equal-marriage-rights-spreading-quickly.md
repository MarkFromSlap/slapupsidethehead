In just this past week, [Sweden](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/04/sweden-gets-equal-marriage-rights/ "Finally, gays can end their boycott on ABBA and IKEA"), Iowa and Vermont have all either passed legislation giving equal marriage rights to same-sex couples, or have had laws banning same-sex marriage struck down as unconstitutional. Clearly, equality is unstoppable!

Eventually, anti-gay lobby groups everywhere will realise this and begrudgingly move on... to attack some other minority group, in all likelyhood.
