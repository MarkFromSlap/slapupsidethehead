![Father tells child that hating gays doesn't actually mean you should attack them. A mixed message.]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/04/mixed-message.jpg' | relative_url}} "Mixed message.")

A 31-year old lesbian was violently assaulted in Edmonton last week in what she and her friends are calling a hate-motivated attack. Shannon Barry required two facial plate implants to repair a broken jaw and crushed eye socket after being kicked in the face while her assailants shouted anti-gay slurs.

Thankfully, an arrest has now been made: A 14-year old boy who cannot be identified by police.

Personally, I find that age pretty shocking. Fourteen. Who and what could possibly influence a kid to assault a woman over twice his age? I mean, other than the religious figures, politicians, lobby groups, and other adult role models who routinely encourage an unnatural hatred toward an entire minority group.
