![For legal purposes, these are actually the Stintflones.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/02/flintstones-in-asia.jpg' | relative_url}} "For legal purposes, these are actually the Stintflones.")

STAR, a Pan-Asian television network owned by Rupert Murdoch, is drawing criticism this week for its decision to censor their broadcasting of the Oscar telecast on Monday morning.

Audiences found that all occurrences of the words "gay" and "lesbian" were deleted from the ceremony's acceptance speeches, specifically those of Dustin Lance Black and Sean Penn for the film _Milk_.

Jannie Poon, a spokesperson for STAR, was unapologetic, saying that the network has "a responsibility to take the sensitivities and guidelines of all our markets into consideration."

Well, I'm outraged, I am! Being \_\_\_ myself, I find this to be an affront to the sensitivities of the network's \_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_ markets. \_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ viewers all over Asia---as well as the greater worldwide \_\_\_ community---are being told that words and references to anything \_\_\_, such as \_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_, and even \_\_\_\_\_ are so \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that they can't even \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_ or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_!
