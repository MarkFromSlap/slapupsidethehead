A study conducted by Wilfred Laurier University has found that gun-toting voters held the same opinions on controversial topics than non gun owners---with exactly one exception: Same-sex marriage.

Using data donated by Ipsos Reid, researchers noted that of the 5,954 gun-owning Canadians polled, same-sex marriage was the _only_ topic that gun owners opposed in numbers significantly higher than the rest of the Canadian population. Despite their similarities in opinion on other topics, gun owners were also 10% more likely to vote for the Conservative party, which has historically opposed gay rights.

Interesting stuff! Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go pick out some lead curtains.
