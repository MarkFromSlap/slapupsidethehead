![Soccer Gayness](/wp-content/media/2008/04/soccer-gayness.jpg "Or, as it is called in Europe, Footywhopping")

Luciano Moggi, the former managing director of Juventus, Italy's largest soccer club, went on a bizarre tirade against gays this week during a televised interview. The controversial official, who is currently being tried for corruption scandals, said that...

Well, actually, I think I'll just let you read it verbatim:

> There are no gays in football. I don't know if players are against having them in their team but I definitely am. In the teams where I worked there were never any. I never wanted to have a homosexual player and I still wouldn't sign one.
> 
> I'm old school, but I know the ambience of football and a gay wouldn't be able to survive within it. A homosexual cannot do the job of a footballer. The football world is not designed for them; it's a special atmosphere---one in which you stand naked under the showers.

So, there you have it: Gays don't like soccer, and even if they did, any latent athletic ability would be invariably foiled by their beacon of gayness. Which is alright, I guess, since us gays couldn't handle after-game showering without, presumably, violating all our teammates anyway.

Incidentally, while former professional soccer players have come out as gay in the past, no current players are openly out of the closet. I can't help but wonder why that is...
