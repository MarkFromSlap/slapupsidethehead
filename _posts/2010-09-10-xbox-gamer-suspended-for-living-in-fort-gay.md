An American gamer was surprised to find that his XBox Live account had been suspended by Microsoft because the name of his town, _Fort Gay, West Virginia_, was deemed to be offensive.

After discovering the suspension, Josh Moore called Microsoft to re-enable his XBox Live service, but was warned by an employee that entering the name of his hometown again would result in another suspension and that his two year subscription fee of $288 would not be refunded. Josh pleaded with the employee to do a quick  search online and confirm that Fort Gay was a real place, but was told that the town's name contravened the company's policy on offensive language and that nothing could be done.

Confused, Josh contacted the press. "At first I thought, 'Wow, somebody's thinking I live in the gayest town in West Virginia or something,'" Josh told the Associated Press. "I'm not even gay and it makes me feel like they were discriminating," he added.

A spokesperson for Microsoft eventually apologised, calling the screw-up a "miscommunication."

Well, I'm glad it turned out in the end. Besides, it could have been worse. Josh could have been from [Penistone, England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penistone "Stop it! It's pronounced PENNIS-TONE!").
