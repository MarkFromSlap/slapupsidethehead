Looks like Calgary's own [Bishop Fred Henry](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/08/wafer-nazi/ "No wafer for you!") has added a little something to my (unofficial) Canadian Collection Of Defamatory Quotesâ„¢:

> [Same-sex marriage] is the worst betrayal of children I've ever seen---even more so than the Catholic church sex scandals.

Ah, yes. Words that would elicit an awed horror if spoken anywhere other than the ostensibly titled [Let's Talk About Children's Rights](http://www.unitedmothers.ca/pressreleases.htm "HAH!") forum. The forum, held last Thursday in Calgary, was, naturally, composed entirely of hysterical anti-gay rhetoric. Speakers included [Ted Morton](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/08/bill-208-is-back/ "I hear he prefers the name Teddy") and Syed Soharwardy, in addition to the not-so-good bishop, who uttered the above nonsense.
