Hey, kids! Well, I've successfully defended my master's thesis, and now it's time to head even _further_ west to see family. While on the road, here are some stories and updates that caught my eye:

The town of Truro, Nova Scotia, has [adopted an official flag-flying policy](http://thechronicleherald.ca/Editorial/858631.html "A fair policy.") to avoid any more situations like this summer's [Pride flag fiasco](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/ "Has this not left the news yet?"), in which the mayor compared gays to pedophiles. The new policy is straightforward, too: From now on, government flags only.

Statistics from the 2006 national census are in, and when it comes to the same-sex figures, things are clearly up for interpretation:

- [30 percent rise in same-sex couples: census](http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=1&STORY_ID=3582&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 "True.") [Xtra]
- [Canada has only a sprinkling of gay couples: census](http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=2007-09-12T144547Z_01_N12224851_RTRIDST_0_CANADA-MARRIAGE-COL.XML "Well, gays are a minority, right?") [Reuters]

Speaking of census data, [a Calgary SUN article](http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Alberta/2007/09/13/4492504-sun.html) has asserted: "Calgary is holding the fort in a country where the notion of the traditional family is increasingly under siege, states a federal census." Really? The federal census states the traditional family is under siege? Or perhaps this is just a little bit of phrasing bias coming from [Alberta's gayest city](http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Alberta/2007/09/13/4492502-sun.html "HAHAHA!").

With all the attention [Alvaro Orozco](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/09/gay-refugee-speaks/ "he still needs our help, mind you!") has been getting, there's [a great article in NOW magazine](http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-09-13/news_story6.php "Remember to sign his petition, too!") reminding us that this is not an isolated case. [Leonardo Zuniga](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/another-gay-refugee/ "And an upstanding community member."), another gay refugee, is slated for deportation within the next few weeks. Why not take a couple minutes to [help him out](http://www.leonardozuniga.ca/ "Do a nice thing today.")?

Until Friday, kids!
