![Some sound rationalization...]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/05/sound-rationalization.jpg' | relative_url}} "What is happening to our religious freedom!?")

Christian Horizons, a government-funded charity organisation, is appealing a ruling that found them in violation of human rights codes. Connie Heintz, a gay Christian, [was forced to quit her job](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/04/evangelical-group-fined-for-human-rights-violation/ "Nothing witty to say, really") after co-workers discovered she was a lesbian. She filed a human rights complaint and won.

Since Christian Horizons is funded with public tax dollars, it is obligated to respect the rights of the public---including gay employees. With this in mind, I'm interested to hear on what grounds the appeal is based. Religious duty has never included ensuring that no employee is gay, even if you object to their orientation.
