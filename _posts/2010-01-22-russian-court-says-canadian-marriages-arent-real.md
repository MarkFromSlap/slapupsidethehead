Two lesbians that wed in Canada last October will not be seen as married in their homeland. A Russian court threw out their case this week, saying that same-sex foreign marriages simply won't be recognized. "I will have to uphold the decision made by the registry office in May," said judge Boris Gerbekov, "foreign marriages accepted in Russia must involve a couple of opposite sex."

This is the same couple that had [tried to get a marriage license](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/05/lesbians-take-first-marriage-steps-in-russia/ "They shoot!") last May, but [were rejected](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/10/russian-court-says-no-to-same-sex-marriage/ "And it's a miss...") in early October. That prompted them to get a marriage license here in Canada, hoping it would be recognized. Now that their latest attempt has been turfed, they'll appeal to the European Court of Human Rights where a decision could take up to five years.

Rights have to be fought with persistence. Best of luck, you two! It'll pay off someday.
