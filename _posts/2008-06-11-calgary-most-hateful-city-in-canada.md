Calgary has topped the list of the most hate crimes committed per capita of any city Canada, according to a report released by Statistics Canada this week. The study also noted that gays are [more likely to be the victims of violent hate crimes](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/02/gays-at-risk-of-assault/ "Sad, sad stuff.") nationwide than any other minority group.

Neither statistic comes as any surprise. Alberta is home to several individuals who seem to have nothing better to do than publicly voice their distaste for gay people.

Off the top of my head: This week, Stephen Boisson [is appealing a human rights ruling](http://www.saultstar.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1065585 "Because saying I'm sorry is so much harder than launching a lawsuit") that made him apologise for a [hateful letter](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/12/free-speech-hate-speech/ "Don't worry, this doesn't link to the letter!") that may have incited a violent anti-gay attack; Last year, Bishop Fred Henry called same-sex marriage [a worse betrayal of children than the Catholic Church's sex scandals](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/fred-henry-off-the-deep-end/ "Yeah, that logic adds up..."), refused [to give communion wafers](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/08/wafer-nazi/ "That's what Jesus would do, after all.") to politicians that supported equal marriage rights, and separately said that gays are [as evil as prostitutes and adulterers](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/01/bishop-restrict-rights/ "What does he think of actual gay prostitutes, then?"); Rob Anders, MP for Calgary West, crafted pamphlets [linking same-sex marriage with violent gun crimes and crystal meth usage](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/homosexual-sex-marriage/ "Homosexual sex marriage!")---and mailed them to another constituently entirely; Ted Morton introduced legislation that would have [forced teachers to stop all discussions of same-sex marriage](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/anti-gay-bill-targets-teachers/ "Because that's what they do with other controversial topics like war and ethics") unless each student received written parental permission; Ralph Klien used the obscure Notwithstanding Clause to [outlaw same-sex marriage in the province](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/04/ralph-to-leave-throne/ "But they were too late---equal marriage has now destroyed society for good. Oh well.") before the federal law took hold; Bill Whatcott [based an entire mayoral campaign](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/06/mayor-of-edmonton/ "I think he tops it all, personally.") (seriously!) on countering homosexuality, while Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier announced in a mayoral debate that [he doesn't "condone" gay people](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/10/calgary-mayor/ "And I don't condone the mayoral lifestyle"); and Craig Chandler had his [Tory nomination revoked](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/12/tory-candidate-booted/ "Really? Booted from the Tories?") because of anti-gay hate speech published on his website.

With such passionate and unnecessary rhetoric in the province, it's no wonder that some people get the idea that it's OK to react violently to gay people. Alberta's biggest city now has three times the national average of actual hate crimes.
