Looks like the crazies are at it again, attacking their own base! Tory MP Garth Turner is having his riding challenged by radical "Christian" fundamentalists for not supporting a ban on same-sex marriage. Garth is, of course, unfazed by the nonsense.

> Am I supposed to change my mind and all of a sudden hate homosexual people because I'm facing a challenge in my riding? Of course not, I'm not going to change. I'm still the member of Parliament, and I'm still going to do what I said I'm going to do.

A conservative with actual sense? Party on, Garth!
