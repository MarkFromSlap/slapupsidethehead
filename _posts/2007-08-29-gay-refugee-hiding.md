![Hiding Gay Refugee](/wp-content/media/2007/08/hiding-refugee.jpg)

Alvaro Orozco, the Nicaraguan refugee [ordered to be deported from Canada](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-refugee-deported/), has gone into hiding.

Homosexuality is illegal in Nicaragua and Alvaro had been threatened with violence if he returned, but his Calgarian adjudicator, Deborah Lamont, said he hadn't sufficiently [proved he was gay](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/not-gay-enough/) and ordered him to be deported. Since then, all opportunities for appeal have been exhausted.

I'm not sure what the Immigration Refugee Board is thinking, considering that Alvaro's story has been published in the Nicaraguan media. Frankly, it doesn't matter whether or not he can prove he's gay at this point; his safety is threatened.
