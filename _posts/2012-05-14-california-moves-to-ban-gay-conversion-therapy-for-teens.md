![Teenage Mutant Ninja Camel: Nonsensical Conversion Complete.](/wp-content/media/2012/05/teenage-mutant-ninja-camel.jpg "I don't get it either, but it came out of my pen anyway.")

Encouraging news coming out of California this week! The state senate is quickly passing some new legislation that would ban the practice of applying the unscientific and discredited practice of gay "conversion therapy" on anyone under the age of 18. The bill would also make anyone over the age of 18 sign a waver acknowledging that the practice is ineffective and harmful before seeking such therapies.

Conservative groups are already up in arms, saying that the ban tramples the rights of parents to "seek appropriate psychological care for their children." According to the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, however, there is no circumstances under which such therapy is _ever_ considered appropriate. Both organisations have warned, in no uncertain terms, that sexual orientation is unchangeable, and any attempts to treat being gay as a disorder are likely to result in serious psychological harm.

Canada, incidentally, does not ban conversion therapy. In fact, it's a [registered charitable activity](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/action/ "Slap into Action!") here. Here's hoping that California's proposed legislation is signed into law, and that Canada follows suit!
