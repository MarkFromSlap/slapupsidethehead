The [1st World Out Games](http://www.montreal2006.org/home.html "It's like men's olympic diving, but with all sports!") for gay athletes, to be held in Montreal from July 26th to August 5th, has run into a _teensy_ little problem. Nearly 250 of the foreign athletes to compete, it appears, _still_ have not yet been granted visas by the federal government.

Immigration minister, Monte Solberg (who, incidentally, [voted against](http://www.howdtheyvote.ca/vote.php?id=208 "It's in the history books now, kids!") the marriage equality bill last year), issued a statement through his office saying that they are _not_ discriminating based on sexual orientation, and that many visa applications are still in the review process. In fact, it turns out that several of the athletes have _criminal records_ causing the government to go into a lengthy review.

The problem with this? Many of these criminal records are for athletes who were persecuted in their respective countries for **_being homosexual_**.

Hmm... This doesn't bode well, Monte. You might want to speed the review process along here. After all, there's no fury quite like that of a gay man deprived of throwing his men's-diving-watching party!
