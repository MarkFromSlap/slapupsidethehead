![What about the toilets!?](/wp-content/media/2012/11/toilet-on-the-brain.jpg "What do you think of when you hear the phrase ")

Let's do some quick word association. When I say "gender identity," say the first thing tha---OMG TOILETS!!!!

I'm not exactly sure where Ontario's fringe Family Coalition Party gets its funding, considering they routinely get less than a quarter of a percent of the popular vote, but they seem to have enough resources to design and distribute some rather astonishing flyers equating the passage of a bill adding gender identity to the human rights code with bathroom predators.

NDP MPP Cheri DiNovo's Bill 33, which passed in June, finally updated the Ontario human rights code to explicitly include trans Canadians in its existing protections. I guess the Family Coalition Party isn't too happy about it, though, judging from the flyers distributed across Cheri's riding. Referring to the bill as "The Bathroom Bill," the party accuses DiNovo of enabling child predators by letting "a man who calls himself transgendered" to enter women's washrooms, threatening "the lives of girls and women by putting them at greater risk from male sexual predators."

Uh, they do realize that sexual predatory behaviour---_especially_ toward minors---is already illegal, right? Do they seriously think this bill opened some kind of loophole here?

DiNovo, of course, sees the attack for what it is. "The transphobic message of the flyer is that trans folk are, in essence, pedophiles,â€ she told the media. â€œThe whole structure of their argument is ludicrous unless you understand that basic message: there's no such thing as a trans person; there's just male pedophiles dressed as women."

Bravo, Cheri. Now don't waste any more time on these kooks and their crazy flyers.
