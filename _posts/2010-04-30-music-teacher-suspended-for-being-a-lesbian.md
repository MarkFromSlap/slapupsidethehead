![Teacher holds a mystical pink triangle, whose chime turns students gay.]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/04/music-teacher.jpg' | relative_url}} "She's holding it upside down, I think.")

A Vancouver music teacher has been suspended from teaching at a Catholic high school after parents found out that she was a lesbian, according to a news release from the Pride Education Network this week.

Lisa Reimer had taken some time off to celebrate the birth of her first child with her partner. When she returned, she was told that all her music classes had been cancelled and that the remainder of her contract with the school would be spent grading papers from home. The principal noted that while the school administration was confident in Ms. Reimer's teaching ability, many parents were concerned about her "potential influence" on students.  (All gay music teachers, of course, posses a powerful Pied Piper magic that, if gone unchecked, will lead students directly into the river Gay.)

While Little Flower Academy is a Catholic school, it receives public funding and is thereby subject to Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, protecting staff against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The school was quick to emphasize that they didn't actually fire Ms. Reimer, but there are ways to discriminate other than just firing someone. Right?
