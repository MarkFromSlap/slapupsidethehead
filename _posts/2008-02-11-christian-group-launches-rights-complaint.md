Concerned Christians Canada, an Alberta-based Christian lobby group, has announced that they will launch a human rights complaint against the Alberta Tories.

The complaint stems from [the rejection of a Tory candidate's nomination](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/11/premier-reviews-candidate/ "Cue the Twilight Zone music for this one...") back in November. Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach failed to endorse Craig Chandler's candidacy due to a history of anti-gay [human rights violations](http://www.vueweekly.com/articles/default.aspx?i=4434 "As Jesus once said, 'treat those who are different than us as subhuman inferiors.'"). Concerned Christians Canada is furious with Chandler's rejection, accusing the Stelmach government of anti-Christian discrimination.

So, refusing to endorse a bigot amounts to... bigotry?

Lobby chairman Jim Blake called it just that, adding that Stelmach's actions were "reflective of wartime Germany," and that it's all part of a growing initiative to repress Christians:

> It's definitely anti-Christian bigotry. We're concerned about a growing trend of anti-Christian behaviour in politics and society at large.
> 
> If this was done over someone being Muslim or homosexual, there'd be a huge outcry, a riot.

Well, I have to agree with one point: If someone's nomination were rejected simply because they were Muslim or gay, there would be an outcry.

However, Chandler was not rejected simply for being Christian; if that were true, most of the MLAs in Stelmach's government wouldn't be there today either. Chandler was rejected because he repeatedly infringed upon the human rights of gay people. Having been raised Catholic, I'd argue that such views are decidedly non-Christian.

Blake's faulty justifications aside, this human rights case doesn't have a hope of succeeding. Human rights statutes prohibit discrimination in services that are commonly available to the public. Having your candidacy rejected because you don't represent the views of the political party to which you applied does not fall in that category.

Concerned Christians Canada knows that this case is destined to fail, though. Their HRC complaint is a publicity attempt that will gain additional attention once their case fails. At that point, they'll accuse the commission of having a bias toward gay and Muslim groups and present their failure as a flawed case study in their campaign to have the [HRC abolished](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/01/bishop-restrict-rights/ "Because nothing is as anti-Christian as human rights").

'Cause opposing human rights is exactly what Jesus would do, apparently.
