Google, the California-based search giant that I've just totally wasted my first sentence even bothering to describe, is continuing to follow through with its support of same-sex marriage. The company announced on Thursday that they had officially signed an amicus brief in support of court challenges aiming to strike down the ill-conceived Proposition 8:

> Denying employees basic rights isn't right, and it isn't good for businesses. We are committed to preserving fundamental rights for every one of the people who work hard to make Google a success.

In protest, anti-gay lobby groups will now use a methodical guessing procedure to find websites---at least until their own search portal, www.search-engine.jesus, goes live.
