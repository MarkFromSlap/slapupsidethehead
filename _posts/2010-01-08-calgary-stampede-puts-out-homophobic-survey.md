The Calgary Stampede, Calgary's annual carnival and rodeo, has launched a marketing research survey that asks respondents for opinions on blatantly sexist and homophobic statements. Gems include "The only acceptable definition of a family is a husband, wife and children," and "Some jobs are best suited to men. Women should just accept this."

Doug Fraser, a spokesperson for the Stampede, said that the statements don't reflect the opinions of the Stampede, but are part of an standard research package to help develop a product that reflects a "rapidly changing community."

Oh, I get it! They're not being homophobic and sexist at all; they just want to tailor a unique Calgary Stampede experience to people that are. How thoughtful!

Yvonne Brouwers, president of the research firm that developed the statements, said that the questions have been used without incident for 15 years and are designed to identify divisive opinions to "get a better understanding of differences and similarities."

Yep, those statements sound 15 years old alright. I wonder what ads and events they'll help shape...
