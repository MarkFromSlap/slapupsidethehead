![Blessings for (almost) everyone!](/wp-content/media/2007/11/blessings-for-everyone.jpg)

Montr√©al and Niagara are the two latest Anglican churches to approve the blessing of same-sex couples within the past month, defying a national decree to disallow such blessings.

The Canadian Anglican Church decided in June that same-sex blessings are [compatible with core church doctrine](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/06/anglican-mixed-message/ "Confused yet?"), but decreed that they be banned anyway. This mixed message has caused a bizarre rift in the church, with several priests [being ejected](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/10/another-priest-suspended-for-performing-same-sex-wedding/ "Compassion from a priest!? We'll have none of that, thank you!") for blessing couples. That may sound a little drastic, but I'm assured that there's nothing quite like blessing a loving couple within the parish community to undermine years of goodwill, charity, and other selfless services to the Church.
