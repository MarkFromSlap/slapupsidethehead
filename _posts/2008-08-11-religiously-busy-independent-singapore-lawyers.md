In my web travels, I often collect stories that I _intend_ to share, but then become distracted by newer, shinier stories---or feel too lazy to illustrate them. This is what becomes of those stories: a **[Pile o' Slaps](/category/pile-o-slaps/ "Part four of the ongoing saga, like sands in the hourglass...")**!

While the Anglicans are [battling each other](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/?s=anglicans "Too many individual stories to link to now") over whether or not to bless gay couples and clergy, the Lutheran Church is [facing censure](http://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAN1648885220080516 "It's just a big word for ") over doing just that. Ooh---_Burn!_ That'll learn 'em for interpreting ancient texts relative to cultural understandings!

Tom Lukiwski, the Tory MP who said he would "spend the rest of my life making amends" to the gay community after [using homophobic slurs](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/04/sask-mp-apologizes/ "Click at your own risk."), refused an invitation to join in his riding's gay Pride celebrations. His rationale: [He's too busy](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/06/02/mp-pride-events.html "Oh, the paperwork!"). Interesting, 'cause I'm too busy to believe him.

A television station in Singapore has been [fined for showing a gay couple](http://www.canadianbusiness.com/markets/headline_news/article.jsp?content=D90888G00 "The colour they chose was CRIMINAL") decorating their nursery in a home renovation show. Singapore law forbids images and stories of gay people in the media, lest the country catch a bad case of the gay. Wait a sec... Since this site is accessible worldwide, that makes it illegal. And you, the readers, are now participants in a seamy, criminal underworld. Oh yeah, this site just screams "badass."

Craig Chandler, the former Alberta Tory nominee who was [booted from the party](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/12/tory-candidate-booted/ "A TORY booted over HOMOPHOBIA. Drink it in.")over homophobic remarks and human rights violations, lost his bid as an independent in a [landslide victory for his opponent](http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=7e325044-f196-475c-a2f0-5468219e098d "I'd like to write a poem about this justice"). Funny---he [said that he was winning](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/02/craig-chandler-hits-snag/ "And it must be true if it came from a politician") after some in-house polling. Does that mean we can no longer trust the claims of politicians

Finally, over 1500 same-sex couples who were awarded Canada Pension Plan benefits in a class action lawsuit can expect to actually receive their pension after a court decided that the case lawyers were [not entitled to $15 million dollars](http://www.winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2008/03/20/5059346.html "How did the judge see through the lawyer's puppy dog eyes?") in fees they were planning to take from the award. Imagine that; all those poor lawyers ever wanted to do was charge exorbitant amounts to the public purse for simple justice and equality.

Well, have a great Monday!
