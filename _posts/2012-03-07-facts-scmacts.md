Slate investigates the claims that same-sex marriage will have all sorts of negative effects on society, finding that [facts simply don't support this claim](http://slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/03/gay_marriage_doesn_t_harm_children_but_the_facts_don_t_seem_to_matter_.html). Then, again, facts aren't exactly an occupation if the anti-gay lobby.
