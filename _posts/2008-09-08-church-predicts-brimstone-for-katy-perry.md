A tiny church in Backlick, Ohio has drawn some ire from local residents over its illuminated sign out front: "I kissed a girl and I liked it. Then I went to hell."

The text is, of course, a reference to a hit song by Katy Perry, though I'm not sure why they don't share the world's enthusiasm for mass-manufactured pop music. When asked about the sign, Reverend Dave Allison said that the message shouldn't be a shock to anyone, saying that the sign was posted "as a loving warning to teens."

Aw, gee. That really makes you feel loved, doesn't it?
