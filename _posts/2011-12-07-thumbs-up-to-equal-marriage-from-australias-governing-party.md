The Australian Labor Party officially adopted policies in support of full equal marriage rights for same-sex couples last week.

That's an encouraging sign, certainly increasing the likelyhood of a successful same-sex marriage bill being introduced in parliament.

Canada's governing Conservative party, incidentally, officially adopted [an opposite policy](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/06/tories-raise-the-spectre-of-a-same-sex-marriage-ban/ "Tories Raise The Spectre Of A Same-Sex Marriage Ban") during its last convention, supporting the revocation of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples in Canada. But, given Stephen Harper's history of plagiaris---err... I mean, _[enthusiastic imitation](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080930/election2008_speech_react_081001/20081001?s_name=election2008 "Stephen Harper plagiarizes Australians, you see.")_---of Australian politicians, perhaps the Tories will now reconsider.

Here's wishing Australia the best of luck in its journey toward full, equal rights!
