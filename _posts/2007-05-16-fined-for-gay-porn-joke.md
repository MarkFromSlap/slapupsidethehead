![I (slap) Lame Pranks](/wp-content/media/2007/05/i-slap-lame-pranks.jpg)

You know how these police busts go down: A police officer gets a warrant to search a house, finds drug evidence, and replaces the subject's computer desktop image with the message: "I â™¥ gay porn."

Heh, get it? Now the computer desktop suggests that it's owner enjoys gay porn and is gay! What a gas!

Comedy aside, Constable Christa Pennie, who was ultimately fined 20 hours' salary for her prank, turned herself in, expressing regret over the incident:

> From the very beginning I've had remorse over it. I don't have any excuse for my behaviour, and making an excuse just cheapens it all.

Pennie also put dental floss between the teeth of two of the subject's (presumably hideous) ornaments.
