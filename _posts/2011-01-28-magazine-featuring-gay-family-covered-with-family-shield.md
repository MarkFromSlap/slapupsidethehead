Harps, a small grocery chain in the southern United States, issued an online apology this week after using a "family shield" to cover up copies of _Us Weekly_ featuring a photo of Elton John, his husband David Furnish, and their newly adopted baby.

The shield, a piece of opaque plastic about the size of a magazine cover, is labeled with the words: "Family Shield: To protect young Harps shoppers."

To protect them from... photos of families? Well, I can't say they didn't name it appropriately.

Still, what a marvelously stupid concept! It gives me an idea.
