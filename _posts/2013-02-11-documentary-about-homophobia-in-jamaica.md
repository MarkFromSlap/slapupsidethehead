Check out this trailer for [An Abominable Crime](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1944650317/an-abominable-crime-violence-and-homophobia-in-jam "Worth supporting"), a documentary about the rampant (and often ignored) homophobia problem in Jamaica. The filmmakers are currently fundraising to help get this film finished, and The Pulitzer Center has offered to match all Kickstarter donations. So go check it out and offer some support if you can.
