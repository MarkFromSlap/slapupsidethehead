It's fairly well known that Mormons can convert other people to Mormonism posthumously, no matter what beliefs that person may have had when they were alive. Not too many people know, however, that it's also possible to [turn dead Mormons gay through the powers of the Internet](http://alldeadmormonsarenowgay.com/ "Seems legit to me!")!
