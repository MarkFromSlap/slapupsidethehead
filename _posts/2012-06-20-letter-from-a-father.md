Father's Day may have already passed, but you should still read [this amazing article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/fashion/modern-love-a-father-a-son-and-a-fighting-chance.html?pagewanted=all) from a father published in last Sunday's New York Times. (On a related note, Slap-branded tissues will soon be available for purchase. Don't read another touching letter without one!)
