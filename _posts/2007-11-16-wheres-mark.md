If you're reading this, it means I wasn't able to find Internet access in time for today's post. Well, that---or I've met an untimely demise.

In the meantime, here are some of my personal favourite Slaps in the past year:

- [And Now, A Reader Mistakes Slap As Homophobic](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/07/reader-mistakes-homophobic/)
- [Town Council Misunderstands Pride Flag](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/)
- [Anything Remotely Gay To Be Outlawed in Nigeria](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/anything-gay-outlawed/)

Have a great weekend, kids!
