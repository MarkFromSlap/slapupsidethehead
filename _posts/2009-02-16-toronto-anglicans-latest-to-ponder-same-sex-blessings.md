![This is silly. Sorry.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/02/anglicanbot-9000.jpg' | relative_url}} "This is silly. Sorry.")

The gravely divided Anglican church is super interesting for some reason. The issue of same-sex blessings, of all things, has become the epicentre of a massive fracture, and their attempts to stay united has led to some of the most bizarre declarations I've heard from any religion.

Why, just in June, 2007, Canadian Anglican leaders congregated to discuss what to do about same-sex blessings and their divided church. After intense debate, [they officially declared](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/06/anglican-mixed-message/ "It's flip-flop season all year 'round!") that same-sex unions are perfectly compatible with the core doctrine of the church. Hours later, they voted to forbid the blessing of same-sex couples.

Since then, several of Canada's Anglican diocese have broken ranks with the church to bless same-sex parishioners. Toronto Anglicans are now about to join the Ottawa and Montr√©al diocese in allowing the blessing of same-sex couples. (And, just to be clear, we're just talking about blessings here; not even marriage.)

But the church is in pretty rough shape. [Priests have been fired](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/10/another-priest-suspended-for-performing-same-sex-wedding/ "I'll teach you to interpret the bible differently than me!"), [churches have split](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/12/more-anglicans-leave/ "It's for the good of the community?")---with some opting to [become part](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/02/prize-winning-zombie-basketballs/ "Second paragraph.") of the Anglican community located in the province of Southern Cone, South America. They've even [barred some of their own bishops](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/07/worldwide-anglican-conference-bars-their-own-bishop/ "It's a productive way to spend their time.") from attending conferences, all due to same-sex blessings.

From their actions, though, it seems they can all agree on at least one thing: This is _definitely_ the best use of their resources. You know, instead of things like, oh... Housing the poor, tending to the sick, etcetera, etcetera...
