Xtra, a gay community newspaper published by Pink Triangle Press and distributed nationwide, has been targeted by vandals in the Toronto area. Several distribution boxes have been spray painted with homophobic slurs, glued shut, turned upside down, filled with garbage, and set on fire.

This isn't the first time the publisher has been hit by homophobic vandals. "This has been going on since 1993 or 1994," noted Ted Hawkins, a distributer for the newspaper. "It seems to be a crazy homophobic group that has a vendetta for our magazines," he said.

Sounds like a costly problem. My suggestion: Make the boxes look like _adorable_, fluffy kittens with big, watery eyes. They'll meow softly and paw at your legs each time someone takes an issue. Don't get me wrong: Violent homophobes are probably just as likely to burn kittens, but it should look sufficiently horrifying that witnesses would be more likely to report it.

Just an idea.
