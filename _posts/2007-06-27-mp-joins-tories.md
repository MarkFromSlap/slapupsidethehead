Joe Comuzzi, the Liberal MP who resigned his cabinet position over same-sex marriage in 2005, is now the Tories' latest member.

Comuzzi was a member of the Liberal party for 18 years, but left his swanky cabinet gig in disgust over the party's support of same-sex marriage. Later, he was kicked out of the party entirely for supporting the Tory budget against party lines. Until yesterday's move, he was sitting as an independent.

Of course, I imagine that half of the Tory caucus strongly disagrees with their latest member's admission, and will vehemently insist that Comuzzi run in a by-election first. At least, that's how I remember the party [feeling about this sort of thing](http://www.quivotequoi.ca/vote.php?id=241 "I'm sure they haven't changed their minds") in 2005...
