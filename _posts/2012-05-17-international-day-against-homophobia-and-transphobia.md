Today's the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia, a magical day where anything can happen---including a public endorsement by... Toronto Mayor [Rob Ford](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/ford-cheered-for-surprise-appearance-at-anti-homophobia-event/article2435839/)?  There can only be one explanation: A Dickensian epiphany, ghosts and all. _A Merry International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia to everyone!_
