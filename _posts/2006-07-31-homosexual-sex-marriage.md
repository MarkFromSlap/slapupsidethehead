![Retroactive Slap]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/07/retroactive.jpg)Ah,' | relative_url}} Rob Anders. My former MP. Although he's probably best known for being the sole dissenter in a vote to give [Nelson Mandela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandella "Read about the man, I dare you!"), international hero, honorary Canadian citizenship (Anders said Mandela is a "communist and a terrorist"), I remember him for some equally baffling shenanigans.

Now how did it go again? Oh, yes! Anders used taxpayer money (rather than money from his party) to print flyers, emblazoned with a scary masked gunman, linking crystal meth usage and crime to---and I quote: " **homosexual sex marriage.**" Then he mailed them to constituents _in another province_!

Raymond Chan, the **Liberal** MP for that region, was confused why another MP was targeting his constituents with such a bizarre tactic.

> They're resorting to fear-mongering, if you look at the layout of this brochure. And also they're so outrageous. [Sexual] orientation is not a crime since the '70s.

Chan's campaign office was just as confused.

> It's consistent with the concerns that some people have had with the social conservative agenda, coming out and talking about crime and throwing homosexuality into it.

Now, I can't help but wonder what Anders thinks about heterosexual sex marriage? I wonder...
