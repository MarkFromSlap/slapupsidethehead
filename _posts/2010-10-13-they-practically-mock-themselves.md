In the four-and-a-half years this site has been around, I've gotten quite a few reports from people who have seen my drawings in some pretty strange contexts. Just this week, for example, I learned that a Vietnamese restaurant in Kingston, Ontario is using a Slap illustration in their Thanksgiving ads. (I'm optimistic that this means a free meal is on its way, because I could really go for some Phá»Ÿ gà right about now!)

Of all the illustration thefts though, my favourite are from anti-gay forums, Facebook pages, and blogs. Violating international copyright laws is one thing, but using the evidence to publicly mock yourself is delightfully nutty.

In that spirit, let's do the meta thing today! Presenting my **top-most stolen illustrations used for anti-gay purposes by people who clearly can't tell they're being made fun of**.

![A town gathers around a Pride flag, pondering at how the mayor was tempted by the devil.]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/08/city-hall-gay-pride-flag.jpg' | relative_url}})

I'm not too sure what everyone who stole this image assumed I meant when I drew it. It originally accompanied a post about [how people misunderstand the point of Pride flags](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/ "An obvious context, I thought."), but I guess it's more easily interpreted to mean that if children ever see a rainbow, their sexual orientation will instantly set its arrow to **_Ã¼ber_ gay**. Like most copyright infringements against me, I didn't document all the times this was stolen, but at least JJ over at Unrepentant Old Hippie [caught one of them a while back](http://unrepentantoldhippie.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/thou-shalt-not-steal-bitchez/ "Delightful!") for posterity.

![A radio tower emits rainbow waves as people run in horror.]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/04/gay-waves.jpg' | relative_url}} "It didn't make much sense in context either.")

This barely made sense in [its original context](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/04/gay-radio-station/ "It's about Toronto's gay radio station"), but seeing it on _at least a dozen_ generic (as in having nothing to do with the T-Dot or radio towers) anti-gay Facebook groups and blogs makes even less sense. Perhaps they think we _insatiable gay activists_ are actually erecting full-spectrum laser towers to terrorize... what? Train Operators?

![An anti-gay nurse assumes a gay patient has AIDS.]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/07/suspended_nurse.jpg' | relative_url}} "Rationality much?")

This drawing, which I apparently made when I was 2, has been stolen _hundreds_ of times by my estimates. It accompanies a post about [a real-life male nurse](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/anti-gay-nurse-suspended/ "I really ought not imitate real life, I guess")who pickets health centres, claiming that all gay people have AIDS. I'm not sure what I can say to justify this thing, other than that if I knew so many people would see it, I probably wouldn't have held my pen with chopsticks instead of fingers.

![A man chases his children with a green monster on a stick in preparation for encountering a gay.]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/11/gay_drill.jpg' | relative_url}})

If the previous illustration has been stolen hundreds of times, [this one](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/11/human-rights-fine/ "I didn't think anyone could take it seriously, really!") is probably approaching the _thousands_. To demonstrate, there's [a great Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2397553483 "Check it out from time to time.") dedicated to reporting other, homophobic groups that violate the site's terms of service, and at any given time, two or more of them will have this set as their **profile picture** , _guaranteed_. I can't even tell you the number of forums and message boards this has appeared on. And all from people who, apparently, think chasing their children with cut-outs of green, leather-clad monsters on a stick is actually a pretty good training exercise in case they encounter a real life gay. My intention was to exaggerate the already irrational hysteria about gay people, but it's now clear that I really ought to capitalize on this. The monster-cut-out-on-a-stick business must be a lucrative one! It'll be a great investment opportunity for you, too. (Contact my CFO for details.)

Of course, if you see a Slap somewhere out in the wild, be sure to let me know. A high-profile theft from some well-publicized anti-gay organization is overdue, I just know it!
