![The Flying Nun Returns: Rapidly redistributing homophobia from public schools into Catholic ones during times of postal lock-outs!](/wp-content/media/2011/06/flying-nun-returns.jpg "If Hawaii Five 0 can come back on the air, so can this.")

The Burnaby School Board unanimously adopted its anti-homophobia policy last week, after months of debating and church-organized protests. A crowd of about 400 students and supporters cheered outside the Burnaby School Board offices when Kaitlin Burnett, a supporter of the policy, emerged to announce its passage.

The new policy means that public schools in the region will be made safer for any student who is---or is perceived to be---gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, the Toronto Catholic School Board introduced several new, gay-unfriendly amendments to its equity policy. Included among them is one that explicitly enshrines the board's religious doctrine as taking "precedence over human rights protections," and another that states the board will "approve only clubs which have goals that are not inconsistent with Catholic faith and the Catholic Church's moral and doctrinal teachings" (which, in Catholic-speak, is a direct strike at the growing support for Gay-Straight Alliances in their schools---important peer support groups statistically shown to reduce bullying and increase student safety).

Having spent my entire grade school education in the Catholic system, I can vouch that it's survivable---in the same way that Vegemite is a breakfast condiment---but things could be improved, particularly since these schools are tax funded. Until that's no longer the case, I foresee a difficult road ahead for these sorts of amendments. What might seem like a step backwards now, could be the final straw and signal the end of this kind of nonsense for good!
