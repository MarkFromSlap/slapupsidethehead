![Sociology Book](/wp-content/media/2007/05/sociology-book.jpg)

An American dad is furious with [Amazon.ca](http://www.amazon.ca/ "Maybe you haven't heard of it...") after his daughter found a sociology book using the site's search function.

The book---a compilation of academic essays compiled by Todd G. Morrison, PhD---is entitled [_Eclectic Views on Gay Male Pornography_](http://www.haworthpress.com/store/product.asp?sku=5349 "Imagine; a book on an online book store!") and was listed among the three pages of results for the keywords "science videos".

The father was inconsolable:

> My child wanted to know what this stuff was all about. Imagine my shock and awe!
> 
> [Amazon said] they don't censor their materials, and will be inclusive of Gay material. I replied back and asked how a science video search could return pornography. So far, no answers.

You know, I think I'll start an [Amazon Wish List](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/registry/3QDHR9ZZ13P94 "But what should be my first item wish?").

As for why a search for "science videos" would turn up this book (which is notably _not_ pornography), I have one explanation: _Amazon's search feature sucks llama gonads_.

Still, though it's far too late for the daughter (she has undoubtedly turned gay after this fiasco), I have to say the book sounds like an interesting read. Even if it turns out to be horrendously dull, a collection of essays is a great way to deal with insomnia.
