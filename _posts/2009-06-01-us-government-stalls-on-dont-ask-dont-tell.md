![Rated G for violence, 18A for gayness.](/wp-content/media/2009/05/dont-ask-dont-tell.jpg "Rated G for violence, 18A for gayness.")

The United States Department of Defense is asking for more time before an end to the ban on gays and lesbians serving in the military is considered. U.S. president Barack Obama had campaigned to repeal the ridiculous "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which forbids gays from serving, but has since been silent on the issue.

Over 12,500 gay men and women have been discharged from the United States military under the gay-banning policy, including 219 since President Obama took office. So, while top advisors and the military are all pleading for a delay, my brain is pleading for a _sane_ reason for why this issue could possibly be complicated enough to require all this extensive preparation.
