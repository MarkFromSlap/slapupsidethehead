The Muslim Council of Britain [has declared](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/20/muslim-council-of-britain-marriage-equality-for-gays-unnecessary-and-unhelpful/) that equal marriage rights are "unnecessary and unhelpful." What a coincidence---I was just thinking the same thing about declarations from the Muslim Council of Britain!
