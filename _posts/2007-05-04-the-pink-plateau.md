**The Pink Plateau.**  
A Haiku Collection.

I step quietly  
the wind stirring long pink blades  
a boundless plateau

Well, not a real field  
a metaphorical one  
the "gay glass ceiling"

The corporate world  
is harsh and unforgiving  
as John Browne found out

Don't you find it strange  
one would risk resignation  
over coming out?

Clients shouldn't flee  
careers should not be ruined  
just because you're gay

So start the mower  
we've got pink grass bags to fill  
for downtown pinkville
