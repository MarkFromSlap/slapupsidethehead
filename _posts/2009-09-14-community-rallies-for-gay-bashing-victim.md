The Thunder Bay community gathered to take a stand against homophobic violence on Friday after a gay man endured a vicious attack just one week before. Jake Raynard says he and some friends were assaulted outside a local bar because they were gay, with Jake bearing the brunt of the attack---ultimately requiring reconstruction surgery to repair multiple fractures to his head and face.

These attacks are unacceptably frequent, and the victims often don't come forward. I believe that [hiding from homophobia solves absolutely nothing](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/10/hiding-from-homophobia-is-not-an-option/ "Not an option."), so I applaud Jake's brave stance in making himself visible after such an attack. Homophobia affects everyone, [even straight people](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/08/walk-the-bridge-in-my-shoes-homophobia-affects-everyone/ "No one is immune to vicious, even fatal anti-gay attacks."), so it's important to take a stand, be visible, and vocal.
