![Anti-Gay Advertisement](/wp-content/media/2008/03/anti-gay-advertisement.jpg)

CTV has pulled an ad for a Christian, ex-gay ministry after it was found to violate the station's ethical standards.

The ad, which featured an unknown person claiming to have changed his sexual orientation from gay to straight, hinted that recent advancements in equality for gay people has somehow been preventing the public from learning about him:

> You hear about gay rights, gay marriage, and the gay lifestyle being taught in our public schools to children. But what many people don't realize and seldom hear about is that many homosexuals don't want to be homosexual. What many who are struggling with homosexuality don't realize and seldom hear is that they can change. I should know. For 13 years I used to be one.

The ad directs viewers to the Life Productions Ministries website, where no information or explanation is offered. Instead, they suggest that visitors enter their private contact information so the site owners can "direct you to the resources you or your loved one needs to overcome homosexuality." No privacy policy or guarantees of confidentiality is mentioned, and the website suspiciously informs individuals that "due to high volumes of mail we regret we cannot answer everyone."

Ex-gay reparative therapy is often promoted by religious organizations and lobby groups, but professional and medical organisations unanimously reject the notion that sexual orientation is something that can and should be changed. [The American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/appropriate.html "But what do they know?"), [American Academy of Pediatrics](http://www.clgs.org/5/5_6_1.html "Who listens to pediatricians, though?"), [American Medical Association](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/14754.html "But they're hardly credible now, are they?"), [American Counseling Association](http://www.clgs.org/5/5_6_2.html "We're supposed to trust councilors?"), and [American Psychiatric Association](http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 "It's all a conspiracy, I'm sure.") have all gone on record to say that ex-gay ministries are ineffective at best, and psychologically harmful at worst.

CTV has apologised for the ad, noting that they "do not condone, promote or engage in discrimination against anyone based on [...] sexual orientation".
