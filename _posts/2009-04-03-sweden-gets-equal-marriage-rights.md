![Ja!]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/04/sweden-surprise.jpg' | relative_url}} "Ja!")

Sweden's parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage on Wednesday. The vote---which, despite its date, was no April Fool's joke---passed with an impressive 226-22 support, making Sweden the seventh country worldwide and the fifth country in Europe to provide equal marriage rights to all citizens. The law comes into effect May 1<sup>st</sup>.

Neat! And I didn't think it was possible for more gays in Sweden to sing "[I do I do I do I do I do](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCPQ6mNsYbk "Take THAT! Now this song shall be stuck in your head all day.")" then there already were. Congratulations, you guys!
