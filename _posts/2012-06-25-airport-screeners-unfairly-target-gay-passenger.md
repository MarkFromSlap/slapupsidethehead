An inspection of staff behaviour at London's Gatwick airport has uncovered an incident where a gay passenger was searched under suspicion of pedophilia "because he had a camera and a boyfriend."

The incident was just one of the 71 percent of searches deemed to have been conducted inappropriately.

The chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, John Vine, said he was "very concerned to learn of discriminatory practice in the conduct of detection activity."

I'm glad this kind of blatant discrimination isn't going unnoticed at Gatwick. Still, from now on I'll be having my privacy violated at Heathrow airport instead, _thank-you-very-much_!
