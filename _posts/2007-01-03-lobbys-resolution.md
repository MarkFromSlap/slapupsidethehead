![Lobby New Year](/wp-content/media/2007/01/lobby_new_year.jpg)

Hey there, kiddos! I'm back from my little website holiday, and let me be the first---well, more likely the several dozen-th person to wish you a happy and prosperous new year!

And, of course, I come into the new year bearing some tremendously fascinating news from the anti-gay lobby! Our good friends at Focus on the Family Canada---in conjunction with the Institute for Canadian Values---in conjunction with the Canada Family Action Coalition---have formed an "informal coalition!"

Wow! Just think what _new_ ideas they'll come up with together! Do you think they have a name yet? If not, I'd like to suggest _The Canadian Family Values Institute for Action Coalition Focusing_. That, or _The 'I Rather Dislike Gays' Club_. Whichever communicates their objectives more effectively.

Anyway, their first goal is to lobby the government into ordering a **royal commission** on marriage and families. At least, that's what they released to the press on New Year's Day. (Sounds like _someone_ had a wild new year's eve!)

While the commission would ostensibly include everything from family tax policy to child care, a spokesperson for the coalition mentioned---_in passing_---that it could also "revive the gay marriage issue in Parliament." But, I'm sure that's really just a sideline for the whole movement. You know, _if_ it comes up.

And if Harper doesn't agree to this commission---the ol' _Family Focus Action Institute for Canadian Coalitions_ is prepared to do some pretty hefty damage. As spokesperson, Joseph Ben-Ami, threatened: "Don't expect me to go out and vote Liberal. But I do have an alternative and that's staying home."

_Oooooh!_

Well, until Friday, folks!
