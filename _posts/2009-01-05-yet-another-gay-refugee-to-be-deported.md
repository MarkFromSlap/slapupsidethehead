Yep; I've lost count.

Samuel Kyambadde, a gay, African refugee claimant, has been denied a home in Canada and will be deported back to Uganda where homosexuality is illegal.

Samuel is one of many delegates who came to Canada for the International AIDS Conference in 2006 and then applied for refugee status. Unlike most claimants, however, Samuel based his claim on the fact that he is gay and therefore faces persecution if he returns to Africa. The Immigration and Refugee Board rejected the plea because they said Samuel "lacked credibility."

Gay claimants are particularly unlucky in obtaining refugee status in Canada. Possibly due to scattered fake gay claims, Canadian officials appear to require substantial evidence of the claimants' sexual orientation---a trait that must be carefully hidden in many claimants' home country to avoid persecution. It's a no-win situation, and something that Immigration Minister Diane Finley has been happy to avoid addressing.

If you'd like to write Diane Finley, she may be reached at [Finley.D@parl.gc.ca](mailto:Finley.D@parl.gc.ca). You won't get so much as a form reply from her office, but perhaps if she gets enough emails, she'll actually create one with which she can dismiss all our pleas in the future.

**Update:** Slap reader Matthew writes in to say that, apparently, Diane Finley hasn't been our immigration minister since October, and it is now Jason Kenney. How embarrassing! These things change too frequently; if only there were a way to completely freeze parliament and make sure nothing changes in Canadian politics... [Oh wait](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/09/04/house-prorogued.html "Don't act so surprised.").
