![A gladiator.]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/04/sissy-romans.jpg' | relative_url}} "Figure A. A Gay Roman")

As many of you know, we gays possess supernatural powers capable of untold terrors. Religious ambassadors have identified gay people as the source of everything from [mass bird deaths](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/01/ministry-blames-gays-for-mysterious-bird-deaths/ "Ministry Blames Gays For Mysterious Bird Deaths") to [Earthquakes](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/02/homosexuality-causes-earthquakes/ "Research Breakthrough: Homosexuality Causes Earthquakes!") (and even more mundane things like the [widespread implementation of airport security patdowns](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2010/12/u-s-politician-blames-airport-pat-downs-on-gays/ "U.S. Politician Blames Airport Pat-Downs On Gays")). Until now, though, I don't think we've ever been blamed for the collapse of world empires.

But, lo!

Professor Roberto De Mattei, the head of Italy's National Research Council, declared last week that the "abhorrent presence of a few gays infected a good part of the Roman people," introducing a "contagion of homosexuality and effeminacy" that made the empire susceptible to attack from hordes of manly, barbarian invaders.

Yes, it appears the culture that brought us gladiators and near world domination was defeated by the "presence of a few gays." Clearly, our powers are doubling by the minute! With these capabilities as leverage, perhaps we ought to start making better demands than just equal treatment in law and to be left alone from discrimination?
