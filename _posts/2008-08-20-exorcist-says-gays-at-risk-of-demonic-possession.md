A 73 year old Catholic exorcist, Father Jeremy Davies, has warned that gays are at serious risk of demonic possession, if they aren't already controlled by Satan.

In a book entitled _Exorcism: Understanding Exorcism in Scripture and Practice,_ Davies, who believes that there has been an "explosion in homosexuality" in recent years, said that most of today's gays are the result of "a contagious demonic factor." However, he does also warn that "even heterosexual promiscuity" can be a pathway to having your body used as a puppet for demons and I guess make furniture fly around the room.

What an excellent day for an exorcism... _Hiss!_
