Happy Saint Patrick's Day, kids! If you're planning on heading out to a parade---specifically the world's largest in New York City---you likely won't be surprised that Irish gay groups are _still_ banned from marching (yes, in 2012). Gee, I wonder if there are places where Irish gays celebrating their heritage wouldn't be a problem... Like in, oh, say... [Ireland](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/16/gay-ban-st-patricks-day "Where Irish gays are still free to celebrate their heritage"). Personally, I don't see what the New York organizers are worried about. I mean, the only consequence would be better floats.
