![Sorry about that, Cheif.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/04/cone-of-silence.jpg' | relative_url}} "Sorry about that, Cheif.")

Alberta is amending its Human Rights Act with a provision that will force school teachers to exclude any student whose parents object to the acknowledgement of sexual orientation in classroom discussions. Failure to pull a student from such a discussion---even ones that arise from student questions---could result in a human rights complaint.

This new provision is similar to [Bill 208](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/anti-gay-bill-targets-teachers/ "The bill that just won't die"), a failed private member's bill headed by Ted Morton, which would have forced teachers to issue warning slips to parents before discussing same-sex marriage in class.

What a novel idea, though! Barring students from hearing or discussing any information that parents disagree with. As if the Debate Club wasn't uninteresting enough.
