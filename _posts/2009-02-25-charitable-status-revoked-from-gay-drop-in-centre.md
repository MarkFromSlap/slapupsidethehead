![The Wii in the lobby is really a training simulation.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/02/seniors-centre.jpg' | relative_url}} "The Wii in the lobby is really a training simulation.")

The Pride Centre of Edmonton, a non-profit organisation featuring senior's drop-in activities, a library, mentorship program, clothing bank and youth shelter, is in serious trouble. The centre, which relies entirely on donations, had its charitable status revoked in 2004 after being declared a political organisation by the federal government.

Jocylan McDonnell, one of the Price Centre's board members, said that they have made a significant effort to be non-partisan. Still, despite relocating twice and replacing their board and administrators, it is now ineligable to issue tax receipts.

As Montreal Simon [poignantly notes](http://montrealsimon.blogspot.com/2009/02/stephen-harpers-cons-target-gay-seniors.html "and to whom I tip my hat for the story."), gay seniors in particular have had to endure a lot---much more than younger generations can imagine---and they don't often have access to the peer support that today's youth does. A Gay senior's drop-in centre is a place where they can socialize safely and openly, but Edmonton's is at risk while harmful, vocal, and politically active anti-gay organisations such as Focus on the Family Canada and REAL Women of Canada are still permitted to accept tax deductable donations.

Something's awry, don't you think?

Unless... that crafty senior's centre is up to something that we don't know about yet; something sinister...
