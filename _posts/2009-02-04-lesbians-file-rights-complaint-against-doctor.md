A human rights complaint has been filed against a Winnipeg family doctor who allegedly refused a lesbian couple as patients.

While it's not clear if the doctor actually outright refused to treat Andrea and Ginette Markowski, her chilly attitude and ignorant comments were clear as day. In an interview with the Winnipeg Free Press, Dr. Kamelika Elias said that she didn't know how to treat lesbians, that it was against her religion, and that gay people "get a lot of diseases and infections" with which she has no experience treating.

I'm not entirely sure which religion Dr. Elias claims to profess, but it should be easy enough to discover. I'll just try Googling the relevant commandment: "Thou shalt helpeth others in their hour of need---except whenceforth a forbidden gayness eminates."
