Flour Bluff Intermediate School---a high school in Corpus Christi, Texas---has shut down all its extracurricular clubs after a student requested the formation of a Gay-Straight Alliance, a peer support group that encourages tolerance and anti-bullying initiatives.

The insane move, which has effectively terminated otherwise unrelated clubs such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, was taken by the school administration as a means of banning GSAs without penalty from the Equal Access Act, which would have required the school to provide equal opportunities for student-run clubs, "regardless of their religious, political, and philosophical leanings."

Well, I guess banning all extracurricular clubs is one way to ensure equality, _Texas style!_
