![Victoria Day Surprise](/wp-content/media/2007/05/victoria-day-surprise.jpg)

Hey kiddos! As typical of my holiday posts, there's no new news for today. It is, after all, Victoria Day: The day where Canadians everywhere take a few moments to reflect on how [Queen Victoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria "I hear she's a total drama queen") has personally affected their lives.

Say, is anyone else a little tickled by the notion that Canada's anti-gay lobby is happily taking the day off in recognition of a queen?

Well, until Wednesday, folks!
