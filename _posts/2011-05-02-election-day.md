![King Harper](/wp-content/media/2011/05/king-harper.jpg "King Harper")

Last summer, I got married. To the greatest husband in the world, I should add! We were surrounded by family and friends, outdoors on one of the most beautiful days of the year. I wish I were poetic enough to describe it, because I had never experienced so much joy in a single day, but those of you with an _Emotion-o-tronic 5000_ can attach their USB BrainLinkâ„¢ connector and [click here to experience my wedding day memories](/wp-content/media/2011/05/emotion-o-tronic.html "Emotion-o-tronic required.") via a direct brain emotion transfer.

Anyway, my wedding day was important to me, but it might not have happened had the political landscape been different. On the very first day of campaigning for the 2006 election, Stephen Harper promised to have a Conservative-controlled parliament re-vote on my right to marry. If he had sufficient numbers, it would have damaged my life intimately. I wouldn't be wearing a ring right now.

Well, it's election day again, and Stephen Harper is now asking Canadians for a majority, which would give the Conservatives complete power over Canada's laws and policies.

Before voting today, remember that Harper is not a moderate. He has voted against equal rights for GLBT citizens at every opportunity, and is not done with us yet. Just months ago, he personally voted against protecting trans Canadians from workplace and housing discrimination. And with the party's clear voting history, it would only take a single backbencher member's bill to successfully strip away existing rights, such our hard-fought right to marry.

Today, vote. And vote strategically. It affects you more than you might think.
