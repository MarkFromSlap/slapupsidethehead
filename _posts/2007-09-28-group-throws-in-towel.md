Anchor your bacon, kids! The euphemistically titled Institute of Marriage and Family Canada has officially given up lobbying against same-sex marriage. Dave Quist, the executive director of the (ordinarily quite rabidly anti-gay) organization, cited the "incredibly low" numbers of same-sex marriages in census figures as the reason for abandoning the group's original purpose. (Same-sex marriages in Canada [have risen 32%](http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=1&STORY_ID=3582&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 "Not exactly low...") since the last Census.)

Mr. Quist, parenthetically, was the guy that had called for a [royal commission on marriage](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/01/kablamo/ "Whatever became of that, eh?") as early as January, saying that, because of same-sex marriage, "the institution of family will be eroded---resulting in dire consequences for all of us."

So, what will Dave and the Institute of Marriage and Family Canada be doing with their time now? Frankly, given their fanatical opposition to gays in the past, I never thought I'd see the day they'd move on to other issues. Perhaps they'll lobby against snowcone exports now that the molten caverns of the underworld have... well, you know the clich√©.
