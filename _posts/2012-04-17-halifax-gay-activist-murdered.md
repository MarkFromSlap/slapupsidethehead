Tremendously sad news out of Halifax today as Raymond Taavel, a well-known activist for the gay community, was killed by an assailant while trying to break up a fight outside the city's gay bar. A candlelight vigil is being [organized by the Halifax community to honour his memory](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2012/04/17/ns-community-reacts-taavel-death.html). My thoughts go out to everyone devastated by this senseless tragedy.
