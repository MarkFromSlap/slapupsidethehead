Conservative Justice Minister Vic Toews has blamed "the controversy" over same-sex marriage directly on the Liberals, saying that the equal marriage law "was politically motivated." This, instead of, say, the natural progression of equality confirmed by multiple previous court rulings... But, regardless, you know what _this_ means!

That's right, folks! Vicky, who has been oddly silent about his normally hysterical opposition to equal marriage, is _finally_ speaking out! I missed his antics so.

So what's Vic's latest Crazy Message of Yesteryearâ„¢? Basically, same-sex marriage is "a mistake" that the new conservative government needs to fix.

Oh, but, of course, simply revoking the equal marriage law wouldn't be enough for Vicky, as the Supreme Court would ultimately rule in favour of equality. So, he has also called for parliament to use the obscure notwithstanding clause to override the **9** consecutive lower court decisions **and** any future ruling that would inevitably find opposite-sex-marriage-only laws to be unconstitutional.

Yep, that's our new _ **justice minister!** _

Hey... If Vic can become justice minister with that sort of ideology... Maybe I, Mark, Ã¼ber gay news reporter, can become Super Pope! I'll scribble it onto my "give it a shot" list.
