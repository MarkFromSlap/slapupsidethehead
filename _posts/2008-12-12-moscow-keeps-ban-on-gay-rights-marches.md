![No irony here.]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/12/protest-ban.jpg' | relative_url}} "No irony here.")

Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov has vowed to continue bans on gay rights marches, calling homosexuality "satanic," and blaming the gay rights movement for the spread of AIDS:

> We have banned, and will ban, the propaganda of sexual minorities' opinions because they can be one of the factors in the spread of HIV infection.

What a unique and simple strategy to help stop a worldwide AIDS epidemic: Ban opinions!

Sadly, all attempts at gay rights rallies in Moscow have been [met with violence](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/moscows-violent-anti-gayness/ "No joke for this one."), with no police protection afforded for the marchers. While Canada's rallies are, thankfully, far more peaceful, Yuri's sentiment is still very close to home. Plans for [a small parade in Abbotsford](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/10/small-town-fights-to-stop-gay-pride-parade/ "Apparently everyone thought that a November parade would feature gratuitous nudity."), British Columbia, was met with wild criticism and [had to be changed](http://gay-persons-of-color.blogspot.com/2008/11/chantell-gregg-loses-pride-parade-but.html "Won't someone PLEASE think of the children?") to something smaller.
