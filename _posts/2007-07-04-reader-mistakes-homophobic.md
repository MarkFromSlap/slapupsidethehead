Let's do the mailbag thing today! A (somewhat confused) reader writes:

The only reason you are so angry about it is because you are harboring homosexual feelings inside of yourself. Otherwise, you may be a godless person, I am not sure. Either way, live and let live. If you do not know any gay people, get to know one and ask them if they would choose such a horrible existance [sic]. Would you choose to be descriminated [sic] against or hated upon? Who would? The AIDS comments are disgusting. Ignorant. You know nothing about the disease. What about the people in Africa with AIDS who were bitten by a mosquito? You are ridiculously blinded to the reality of health situations in the world. Get a life and educate yourself. What is your education level? Probably not very high.

Dear Corey,

I'm sorry; I've been a terrible, homophobic blogger. I have, indeed, been harboring homosexual feelings inside of myself, and I suspect my boyfriend has too. To make up for all of my angry, angry writings, I've painstakingly converted this site into a gay-friendly publication. I hope it meets your standards.

As for the AIDS comments, I'm not entirely sure [what I've said about the subject](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/?s=AIDS "Something horrible, I gather"), but I'm sorry for it. And, although HIV [cannot be transmitted by mosquitoes](http://www-rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/aids.htm "Though their bites still aren't very pleasing"), I've forgotten that people in Africa probably find the bites as annoying as we do here. Hereon in, I'll do my best to warn them.

With heartfelt apologies,  
your pal,  
**--Mark, MSc.**

Well, that's all for today! If you'd like to submit something to the Slap Mailbag, fire off an email to:
