Ontario [passed Bill 13 this week](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/06/05/ontario-anti-bullying-bill-final-vote-controversy-over-gay-straight-alliance.html), which forbids school administrators from banning Gay-Straight Alliances. Hooray! The [congratulalien](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/07/ontario-catholic-schools-to-get-glbt-support-groups/) has been vindicated! Good job, Ontario.
