![Remembrance Day](/wp-content/media/2007/11/poppy.png)

Today is the day after [Remembrance Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_day "Lest we forget").

Each year, I reach a greater understanding of the necessity to remember that which I've never experienced. I've been spared the terrors of war, thanks to those who chose not to be.

I'm forever grateful.
