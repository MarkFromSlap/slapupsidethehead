![Guest Slap](/wp-content/media/2007/09/guest-slap.jpg)

Edward Lee is a student of social work at McGill university, focusing on gay refugee and imigration issues. In Part II of his [two-part series](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/09/refugee-needs-support/ "An excellent read"), Ed has asked Alvaro Orozco to share his story in his own words, and outlines what we can do to help.

Alvaro Orozco is a young gay man who fled Nicaragua and is seeking refugee status in Canada. For numerous reasons it is unsafe for him to be in Nicaragua, including recent media attention in his country of origin, and the fact that it is a punishable crime to be gay there.

After months of advocacy and community action, Alvaro received his latest Pre Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) decision on Friday, September 14th. While the application was, again, rejected, Alvaro and his supporters were, fortunately, able to convince the immigration officials that he was not a flight risk and so he was allowed to go back to Toronto (versus getting arrested or deported immediately). The reasons behind the rejection included that the letters of support are â€œhearsayâ€ and do not provide solid proof that Alvaro is in fact gay, and that Nicaragua is a safeplace because there are many cruising spaces, like parks and ruins where people can have gay sex.

**Alvaro now is under a new deportation order for October 4th.** Please read Alvaro's thoughts on what is happening in this article and help him stay in Canada.

I asked Alvaro to write---from his own perspective---about what happened to him and the decision from the IRB. Here is what he had to say:

> The Canadian immigration re-sent the letter from the old PRRA decision  
> of 2005 as my new decision for 2007 (9th august). In 2005, I used to have a different lawyer and I had lost my case. My new lawyer is El-farouk Khaki, who sent 3 months ago 2 new applications, the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) and the Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds application for a stay. Immigration told my lawyer that they had no record of him sending anything. so then immigration called my lawyer and told him that they want to give me one more time until the august 28. but on the 26th (2 days before the deadline), immigration called my lawyer telling him that they have the new application decision of the PRRA of 2007,  
> but I have to show up in Niagara falls on august 28 to pick up the  
> decision. And as i am not feeling well and my stress levels and anxiety are affecting my health, my doctor advised me not to go, so I didn't show up.
> 
> one week after that, immigration called my lawyer and told him that  
> they issued a new date for me to show up to pick up the decision and that is on september 14, this is the 3rd time that immigration are dealing with this application, is clear what they are willing to do with me. to take me away from Canada.
> 
> my message:
> 
> Before I filed my case, I was hoping that I can be granted status in this country because this country is a model for human rights for many countries around the globe. But with the way things have happend, I feel disapointed and am struggling to get over it. This has affected me physically and emotionally. It is not fair the amount of struggles I had since I was a kid and that I never really had a normal life, and I escaped from many countries hoping to find freedom and respect in Canada. But now I am facing this situation where I am being judged on my physical appearance by canadian immigration autorities, and they believe that my life is just a joke and I never been through this kind of life, but I'm a honest person and I always keep what I say and I always work for my dreams. I keep my self positive that better things will happen and I can get over this.

> the most important for me is not only win my case, it is that other  
> people who feel scared to speak out can have a voice and someone who can speak for them but not only people who just speak about immigration issues, but people who care about human rights, about peoples future and equal respect.

There is still something that _you_ can do to help raise awareness about what is happening and help Alvaro to stay in Canada. Here is what you can do:

1. Check out [his website](http://www.orangehabitat.com/oh/alvaro "It contains important resources") and read the latest press release
2. E-mail and/or send a letter to Federal Immigration Minister Diane Finley at [Finley.D@parl.gc.ca](mailto:Finley.D@parl.gc.ca). Let the MP in your riding know what is going on and ask them how they will help Alvaro.
3. Sign [Alvaro's online petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/alvaro/petition.html "Petitions matter")
4. Keep talking about Alvaro with friends, family, media, join his facebook group, etc. 
5. [E-mail Alvaro](mailto:alvaroorozco04@hotmail.com "He's a real person, after all!") and help keep his spirits up!
6. If you want to do more please [contact Suhail](soynewcomer@sherbourne.on.ca "There's a lot you can do to get involved.") at SOY Toronto

Thanks again to Ed for sharing his thoughts on this story, and his communications with Alvaro. If you would like to see more of Ed, check out his short film, Invisible Son, included as a special feature on the Margaret Cho Assassin DVD.

**Related Update:** Bruce at [Canuck Attitude](http://canuctude.blogspot.com/ "A great queer blog") has dug up [a story](http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a772cc19-fd8d-41fe-ae8b-9cb1837c84fa&k=77833&p=1 "This angers me!") about a convicted criminal in Canada whose deportation ruling was _reversed_ because he is in the midst of a "religious conversion." In the meantime, Alvaro's safety is in danger because he can't prove he's gay. Outrageous.
