![Gay Neighbour]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/02/gay-neighbour.jpg' | relative_url}})

Canadians would be more uncomfortable having a gay neighbour than any other minority. At least, that's the news according to a recent poll conducted across various western and Eurpoean nations.

Canada, where nearly one in five people reported they'd dislike a gay neighbour, falls well behind Sweden's 6% intolerance rate, but better than Italy's 28.7%.

Respondents weren't asked why they disliked gays so much, but I'll address the most likely culprit: Garden jealousy.

Yes, it's time to dispel the old myth that a gay garden in the neighbourhood will outshine your own. You see, no houseplant---let alone an actual outdoor garden---has survived my care. Too much water, not enough sun, sporadic fertilization schedule... I'm just destined to be incapable of nurturing a plant. So, if you have me as a neighbour, there's nothing to fear! Your garden will be comparatively better in pretty much every respect. Though I guess it's kind of a moot point, since I live in a downtown apartment.

But, what do you say? Am I welcome in the neighbourhood?
