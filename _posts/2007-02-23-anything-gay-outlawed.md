Get ready for some _serious closet_!

A Nigerian bill is poised to outlaw anything that's remotely close to being interpreted as sort of gay in the country. The bill prescribes a five-year prison sentence for---are you ready for this? Meeting with gays, promoting equality for gays, donating money to gay organisations, expressing gay love in letters and emails, attending or participating in a gay wedding or ceremony, publishing, selling, renting, or loaning a gay book or video, taking or possessing pictures of a gay couple, selling or renting housing to gay couples, and visiting, hosting, or creating gay websites. That, of course, in addition to the _harsher_ interpretations.

Hey, how about that? Slap's actually illegal somewhere! Kudos to you, my law-breaking visitors!

Anyway, misinformation about homosexuality is rampant in Nigeria. A special advisor to the president recently announced that being in a same-sex relationship directly causes "mental retardation, and high tendency to commit suicide."

Fascinating, no?
