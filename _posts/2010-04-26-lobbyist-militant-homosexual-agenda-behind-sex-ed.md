![Charles McVety interrupts sex ed lesson by screaming 'Noooo!']({{'/wp-content/media/2010/04/sex-ed-objection.jpg' | relative_url}} "Incoming ball o' crazy!")

Charles McVety, one of Canada's most frothy anti-gay lobbyists, has warned that a proposed sexual education curriculum reform currently being held for review in Ontario is "part of a militant homosexual agenda to normalize homosexuality in everyone's mind and thereby promote homosexuality."

(Say, wouldn't it be swell if a kitten were born each time McVety uttered the word "homosexuality?" The world would become so much more adorable.)

The proposed curriculum---based on research into preventing teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases---is really just a frank discussion of sexual health issues introduced at appropriate ages.

The earliest grade affected by the reforms, grade three, is taught differences in skin colour, body size, cultures, and families. "Some students live with two parents," one of the documents states, "Some live with one parent. Some have two mothers or two fathers." (Across the country, several kittens are mysteriously willed into existence.)

By grade six, students learn about puberty and the physical changes they will experience. By grade 7, they're finally taught about pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and descriptions of safe-sex practices. Once the students have graduated from high school, teen pregnancy and infection rates will have dropped noticeably.

McVety, always one to expect the unrealistic, describes the whole thing differently, saying that the reform will "subject sixth graders to instruction on the pleasures of masturbation, vaginal lubrication, and 12-year-olds to lessons on oral sex and anal intercourse." And all of this, of course, in an effort to "promote homosexuality."

And who does McVety blame for all these non-existent, step-by-step lessons on anal sex and discussions on the "pleasures of masturbation?" Here's a hint: It's not the health researchers and scientists who back the _real_ curriculum.

"We warned the country about this when same-sex marriage came in," McVety announced to the press, "We changed the laws in this country, redefined marriage, the end result now this is coming into our classrooms."

Such zeal! Such pent-up frustration! Perhaps McVety could use some relaxation time---a vacation---to help reflect on the strong possibility that he's an idiot.
