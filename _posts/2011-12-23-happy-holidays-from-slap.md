Well, I'm off to the prairies for the holidays, spreading all sorts of seasonal merry cheerfulness with friends and family. This does mean, however, that there shan't be any updates until my glorious return in the new year.

Until then, have a great Christmanukkahwanzoliday and an insanely spectacular new year! As always, feel free to interact with me and other Slap fans on the [Slap Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/slapupsidethehead "Face it, booky!"), via [@MarkFromSlap on Twitter](http://twitter.com/MarkFromSlap "Ittertrotter"), and the brand new [Slap Google+ Page](http://plus.google.com/108080544335917602368 "Googley Boogley"). Also, here's an octopus attacking Santa.
