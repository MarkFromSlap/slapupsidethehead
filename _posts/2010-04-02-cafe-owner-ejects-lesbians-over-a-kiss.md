![Kiss prevention]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/04/kiss-prevention.jpg' | relative_url}} "It all took place in slow motion.")

The owner of a café in downtown Waterloo, Ontario, has kicked out a lesbian couple for sharing what they say was a short, closed-mouth, peck on the lips.

Zoey Heath and her girlfriend Jenny Kirby brought their laptops to Café 1842 in order to work on their schoolwork. They started getting ready to leave when they shared a parting kiss. That's when the heard the café owner yell "What's going on here?" as she walked over toward the two, finally saying "Stop that. That's enough. This is no place for that."

Sonia Adlys, the owner of the café, paints a different picture, saying that the two were "necking." "If you want to make love, you go behind closed doors," she said. "We have senior people, families; we're a family restaurant---I walked up to [the couple], yes maybe I was a little loud, and I said 'Excuse me, can you please leave?'"

Presumably, police and trauma councillors were brought in to attend to all those poor seniors, families, and children who may have accidentally witnessed the kiss. The café will also very likely remain closed while authorities investigate the damage.

In the meantime, the Zoey and Jenny say they won't be returning to Café 1842 again, although they're not organizing a boycott. Instead, a Facebook group is [setting up a kiss-in](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Waterloo-ON/Taking-Action-Against-Homophobia-in-Waterloo-Region/100274920013672 "Bring a raincoat in case the owner explodes.") on the premises in protest---a pretty good idea, if you ask me!
