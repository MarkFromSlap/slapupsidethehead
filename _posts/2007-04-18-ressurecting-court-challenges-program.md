![Dead Court Challenges Program]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/04/dead-cc.jpg' | relative_url}})

Defibrillator clear? It's not too late! Opposition Leader Stephane Dion has vowed to restore the [Court Challenges Program](http://www.ccppcj.ca/e/ccp.shtml "R.I.P."), which was [unexpectedly turfed](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/tories-cut-equality-funding/ "Go fund yourself!") by the Conservative government last autumn after lobbying by "pro-family" special interest groups.

The Court Challenges Program was available to any group who wished to [challenge unconstitutional laws](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/go-fund-yourself/ "For those who can't afford justice"), and was instrumental in awarding equal benefits for same-sex couples, among other important rights-related cases.

So, will this program actually be re-instated? Maybe if enough people in the government think that they ought to be protecting people from rights-trampling legislation rather than passing it... But, hey---when has Canada ever done anything [quite so crass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Immigration_Act_of_1923 "Hmm...")?
