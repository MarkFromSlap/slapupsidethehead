Justice Minister [Vic Toews](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/justice-the-vic-toews-way/ "With his own wacky form of justice!") has confirmed that Stephen Harper will keep his promise and vote on whether or not to revisit same-sex marriage before parliament ends this Winter. The vote is expected to fail _spectacularly_, so right-wing special interest groups have been pressuring the government to delay the vote as long as possible.

As for me---it'll sure be nice to finally get this nonsense over with. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's a little like getting through poplar fluff season... Not terrifically threatening, but not too pleasant either.
