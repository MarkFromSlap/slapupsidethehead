Well, I've got **good** news and I've got **eerie** news!

First, the good news: Vic Toews, [Justice Minister Extraordinare](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/justice-the-vic-toews-way/), has been given the ol' steel-toewd boot from Harper's cabinet! Toews, who stated that the 9 consecutive court rulings guaranteeing equal marriage were all mistakes, and who pledged to introduce legislation [legalizing discrimination](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/tories-acting-scary/) against gays, had his own wacky vision of Justice, and shall be dearly missed on this site. (_Sigh._ Now, unless [Jack Layton](http://www.ndp.ca/jacklayton) suddenly turns homophobic, the only moustache I have left to draw is [Bishop Fred Henry's](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/fred-henry-off-the-deep-end/).)

Now, the eerie news: Some of you may have heard of the multi-million dollar [Canadian Museum of Human Rights](http://www.canadianmuseumforhumanrights.com/) to be built in Winnipeg. The museum is supposed to feature an exhibit on gay rights, drawing the wrath of right-wing special interest groups. Lifesite, for example, called the museum a "powerful propaganda institute," adding that its supporters have "made a monster of the word tolerance, [have] raped the word gay, and [have] beheaded the term human rights." And the kicker: Vic Toews, as the new Treasury Board President, supports it!

Yep, you heard right. Toews will be meeting with the museum's planners to discuss a $100 million government commitment, saying "[the museum] certainly is a priority that Manitobans want resolved and I want to see how I can meet our commitments."

So, there you have it! Now, as long as the museum isn't renamed to the _Vic Toews Museum of Human Rights_, it looks like I may actually have a reason to visit Manitoba!
