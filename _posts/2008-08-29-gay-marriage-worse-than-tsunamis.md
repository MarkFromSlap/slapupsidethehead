Let's forgo the mainstream news sources for today. It's time for some blog dredgin'!

Writing from his free account at Mississauga Blogs, [Surjit Singh](http://blogs.mississauga.com/blogs/surjitsinghflora "Complete with a lovely photo."), reporter for Ontario's Hamdard Weekly Punjabi community newspaper, argues against same-sex marriage by comparing it to [the horror and mayhem of tsunamis](http://blogs.mississauga.com/blogs/surjitsinghflora/2008/08/27/same-sex-marriage "How could I have missed the obvious connection?"):

> Scary, Horrifying, Terrifying, Fearsome are the descriptive words used to describe the disaster "TSUNAMI ". The earth full of dead bodies and wrecked houses, buildings is called "Tsunami ". People living on the side walks, under the trees, at the school corners, is called "TSUNAMI ". Also called God's anger! But I think same sex marriage is not less then Tsunami disaster.

Hey, I think we've found a second nomination for this year's [Enjoyable Hyperbole Award](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/?s=enjoyable+hyperbole+award "I'm thinking of actually making this award now.")! And, if I must say so, I think this nominee will sweep up the competition like a tsunami. Singh seems outright convinced that same-sex marriage will cause nothing short of the _end of civilization_. Oh my!

> [...] there will be no more new generation , no more love and romance between men and women  and no more kids, isn't  that more scary , horrifying then Tsunami?

Ah, the classic "everyone will turn gay, not bother to reproduce, and mankind will go extinct" argument. Some would say that line of reasoning has holes the size of tsunamis, but I won't bother pointing them out; I'm much too delighted for having discovered an additional argument against same-sex marriage that I've never heard before:

> [A]nd think about that there will be more abuses and assaults, violences, fights, more people killed every day  because every gay man will try to find in every single man as a homosexual , and a lesbian woman will be looking in every woman as a bisexual.

How could I have missed this connection? Everyone, please, ban equal marriage rights; it's the only way to stop violent homophobia!

And, of course...
