![Mayor of Cardston](/wp-content/media/2006/10/cardston_mayor.jpg)

Well, after all the recent federal news, I think it's about time I gave some attention to small town Alberta!

Remember [Cardston](http://www.town.cardston.ab.ca/ "The little town that couldn't") (population: 3,500)? It's the little town with _big_ aspirations to ban same-sex marriage. Well, after the [Municipality of Crowsnest Pass](http://www.town.crowsnestpass.ab.ca/ "Bigger municipality, more sense") (population: 6000) [refused to hear them out](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/04/cardston-crazies-propose-ban/ "A powerful blow to their cause...") last April, they haven't given up! In fact, they've taken their plea all the way to the capital city of _[Edmonton](http://www.edmonton.ca/ "Where I was born, incidentally!")_ (population: 1,016,000)! Such a big trip!

The [Alberta Urban Municipalities Association](http://www.munilink.net/ "OMG! All the Mayors!") met in Edmonton earlier this month for their annual convention, and Cardston was more than thrilled to propose their ban in front of _all_ the mayors in Alberta! Though, unfortunately for Cardston, Edmonton Councilor and AUMA Chairman Ed Gibbons just didn't seem to want to discuss the proposal:

> This is not the type of issue municipalities typically deal with, nor should they. Why are we talking about it at the convention?

Councilmen were also quick to point out that municipalities don't have the authority to ban same-sex marriage, which is entirely federal jurisdiction.

_Poor Cardston_... You tried _so_ hard. Oh well, I suppose there's always next year's conference!
