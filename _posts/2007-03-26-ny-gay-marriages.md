Start spreadin' the newwws...

The state of New York has become the first in the U.S. to recognize Canadian same-sex marriages. This is exciting news for all those New Yorkers who wished they could tie the ol' metaphorical knot of some sort, but had an aversion to moving out of the country (or to Massachusetts---for what I'd imagine are pronunciation reasons).

Now a temporary hop up north will make the whole thing official. Terrific!

My advice to New Yorkers thinking of getting some exciting Canadian paperwork: Start working on your guest list! Not only is our wedding season short, but certain special interest groups (_Cough._ Canadian Family Action Coalition. _Cough._) are already pushing to [ban foreigners from marrying here](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/01/foreigners-sholdnt-marry/ "Aren't they sweet?"). Though I'm sure their reasons are _completely_ unrelated. I mean, they're lobbyists! They wouldn't do [anything mean spirited](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/go-fund-yourself/ "It's just not in their nature!").
