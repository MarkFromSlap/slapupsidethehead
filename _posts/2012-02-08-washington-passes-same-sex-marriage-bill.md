Equal rights are sweeping through the States like a tsunami of gay! The Washington state House [passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=146603542 "Congrats, guys!") today, following last week's passage by the state senate. All that's left now is for the governor to sign the bill into law, which he is expected to do as early as next week. Wow! At this rate, you guys will have entered this century in no time!
