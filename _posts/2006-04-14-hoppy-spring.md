![Spring Bunny](/wp-content/media/2006/04/spring_bunny.jpg)

Since I'm out of town to visit family for Easter, there'll be no making fun of the anti-gay crazies today. Instead, enjoy this picture of the Entirely Secular Vernal Equinox Bunny, bounding through the grass with a basket of non-religious April eggs! Happy Spring, everyone!
