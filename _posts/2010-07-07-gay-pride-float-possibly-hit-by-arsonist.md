![Bystander mistake a charred pride float as modern art.](/wp-content/media/2010/07/modern-art.jpg "It's brilliant; I'll give you twenty thousand for it.")

The annual gay pride float was a little different this year at Anchorage, Alaska's fourth of July parade after it burned down in what is being treated as possible arson.

Just a day before the Independence Day parade was set to begin, a suspect was seen fleeing from a residential driveway where the float was parked, as weeks of hard work burned to cinders. Neighbours fear that the fire, which also scortched a nearby garage and attic, could be a hate crime.

The float's construction team had a great idea, though. Christening the charred float "Phoenix Rising," they rebuilt it from its ashes and burned remnants using donations from the community. After just one day, the float was finished, entered into the parade as planned, and won the Grand Champion trophy.

What a great display of unity and community pride. It's an inspirational demonstration of exactly why the gay community should be proud of its accomplishments, and why hateful people should feel ashamed.
