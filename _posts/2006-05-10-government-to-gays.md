![Census 2006: You're Not Married!]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/05/census_2006.jpg' | relative_url}})

Well, it's census time in Canada again. Ah, Cenususeses... Censii? Those dainty twice-a-decade questionnaires where you get to inform the government of _all_ your personal relationships. But, for all the happily married gay couples out there this year, don't be so quick to check the "husband or wife" bubble when describing your partner's relationship to you! The government has provided _special_ instructions for _your_ type.

That's right; someone must've missed the point of the whole _equal_ marriage law, because the census form now instructs all same-sex married couples to check "other" instead of "husband or wife" when describing their partners. This would put your beloved spouse in the same category as cousin, niece or nephew, roommate's spouse or child, and, of course, employee.

Naturally, [Egale Canada](http://www.egale.ca/ "A great organisation with a weird name"), a Canadian gay human rights group, is disappointed.

> Everyone who completes the 2006 Census will see that our relationships are segregated. We're already getting phone calls from dismayed members and we're concerned about the subtle yet widespread impact of millions of Canadians seeing that our marriages are denigrated in this way.

Sad. But, who knows? Maybe this new terminology will catch on---even among straight people! Everyone will dream of that _special_ day when they walk down the isle to profess their undying love---to hear those wonderful words, "I now pronounce you _other_ and _other_." _(Sniff.)_
