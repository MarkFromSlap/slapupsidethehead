![An anonymous man ponders over an anti-homophobia policy:](/wp-content/media/2011/11/stupid-death-threat.jpg "And just so they know I'm serious, I won't sign my name.")

A teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia has received a death threat over the school board's proposal to adopt anti-homophobia policies designed to reduce incidents of bullying and make schools safter for GLBT students.

The letter, adorned with illustrations of bloody knives, reads as follows:

> Must immediately withdraw POLICY #5.45  
> Adhere to the basic social principles!  
> You have no right to do so!  
> You want to destroy our children!  
> You are our enemy!  
> You will be shot!

Similar anti-homophobia policies have been implemented across B.C. without issue---and certainly no death threats---but some bizarre opposition in Burnaby has drawn the policy into the national spotlight. A one-issue political party with five candidates, The Parent's Voice, was [formed expressly to oppose the policy](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/10/parents-start-new-party-against-school-anti-bullying-policies/ "Parents Start New Party Against School Anti-Bullying Policies").

While I don't expect that Parent's Voice is officially responsible for the death threat, the alarmist language employed by the party certainly contributes to an atmosphere in which these types of reactions are encouraged. In a press release announced shortly before the letter was delivered, the group called the anti-bullying policies part of a "hidden political agenda" consisting of "homosexual propaganda" and "left-wing social engineering led by gay activists" to undermine parents.

The RCMP is investigating the letter.
