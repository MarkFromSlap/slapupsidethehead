Jenna Talackova, the trans beauty contestant that was booted from the Miss Universe Canada pageant for being born a male, has been [allowed to re-enter the contest](http://www.torontosun.com/2012/04/02/transgender-beauty-queen-back-in-pageant?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Transgender+beauty+queen+back+in+pageant) as long as she meets the Canadian legal definition of a woman, which I believe she does. This is a pretty big, visible step for trans recognition, so congrats to Jenna! Here's hoping the owner of the pageant franchise---a certain Donald---doesn't Trump this decision.
