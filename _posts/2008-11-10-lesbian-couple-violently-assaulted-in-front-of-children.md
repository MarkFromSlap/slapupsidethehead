A court date has been set for a violent attacker who assaulted a lesbian couple as they were picking up their children from elementary school in Oshawa. The attack, which bloodied one of the mothers, was witnessed by numerous children, including the assailant's own son.

Jane Currie and Anji Dimitriou, the victims, described the attack to Capital Xtra and the Durham Region:

> [The attacker] said to Anji, "Which of you two men spoke to my kid? Fucking dyke lesbians." I jumped out and just as I came around he spit right in her face. She wiped the spit off and he punched her in the face and hit her again in the back of the head.
> 
> I said to him, "you asshole what are you doing? You just beat a woman" then bang I got it.

Mark Scott's violent assault left both parents with black eyes, and one with four stitches. Eyewitnesses confirmed that the attack was unprovoked, and likely a hate crime. Currie now says her three children are terrified:

> We went to Zellers and they didn't want to get out of the truck. "What if he's in Zellers?" they asked. "What if he comes back to the school and comes after us?"

What a disgusting assault. The brazenness of it---in front of multiple children---is very hard for me to understand, but I take it as strong evidence for how deep homophobia continues to run.

These assaults aren't common, but the behaviour the attacker learned comes from multiple, definite sources. There are lobby groups, legislators, editorialists, churches, and individuals that continue to portray gay people, through unfounded misinformation, phony research, and scaremongering, as some sort of threat to the very foundations of society. It's in this extreme atmosphere that homophobia, including violent homophobia, can thrive.

This has to be stopped. Challenge verbal homophobia wherever it is encountered. **Challenge it**. Only when it is unchallenged can it escalate to this madness.
