Gay seniors have had to endure more homophobia than younger generations can imagine, yet those brave enough to finally come out are _still_ often treated with abuse and disdain by peers and retirement home workers.

In recognition of this, the Québec government has taken the applaudable step to fund a $500,000 education campaign about gay seniors and the discrimination they face. The education program is so badly needed that the cabinet ministers responsible for it couldn't find a retirement home willing to host the program's press announcement, opting instead to use a community centre in Montréal's gay village.

This is a wonderful idea, and one in which all provinces should follow suit. The first step, I think, shall be to popularize a new hit television program, _Queer as Folk: The Golden Years_.
