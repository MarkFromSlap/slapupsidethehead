![Gay MP Wedding](/wp-content/media/2007/08/gay-mp-wedding.jpg)

[Newspapers](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070810.wbrisonmarriage0810/BNStory/National/home "National newspapers, no less.") and [television](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070810/Scott_Brison_070810/20070810?hub=Politics "National television, too.") are abuzz about the upcoming same-sex wedding of Scott Brison, a Liberal MP. Even reputable publications are gathering information on everything from [who's attending](http://thechronicleherald.ca/Front/9003917.html "A former PM!? Amazing!"), to where the [secret location might be](http://www.hfxnews.ca/index.cfm?sid=53801&sc=89 "My spine is tingling!").

It's a media whirlwind, alright. Just like when any straight MP gets married.
