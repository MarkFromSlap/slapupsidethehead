Monroe County in New York State is appealing [last month's court ruling](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/02/court-upholds-canadian-marriages/ "These things never last long, do they?") that declared Canadian same-sex marriages must be recognized in the state.

Maggie Brooks, a Republican official, called the five-judge, unanimous court ruling a "misinterpretation of the law," adding "we're letting people in Ontario, Canada define marriage for people who live in New York State."

Patricia Martinez and her wife, Lisa Golden, brought the original case to court after Partricia's employer refused to extend spousal health benefits to Lisa. While they aren't surprised that the Republicans are trying to take such basic legal equalities away, they say they'll always have each other:

> We still view our marriage as legitimate. No court decision will devalue or negate what our marriage means to us.

Good on you! I wish them the best of luck.
