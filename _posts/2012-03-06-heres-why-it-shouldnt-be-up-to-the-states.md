Even in jurisdictions where same-sex marriage is legal, gay couples in the United States are paying [a lot more in taxes](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2017642264_pftaxgay04.html) because the federal marriage benefits available for straight couples aren't available to gay ones. I guess that's one strategy for paying down the debt---tax the gays instead of the 1%!
