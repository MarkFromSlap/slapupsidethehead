![Traditional Family Explodes]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/01/family_explodes.jpg' | relative_url}})

So, sometime after lunch on Wednesday, I was disrupted by a peculiar noise not unlike watermelons being dropped off an overpass. At first I was a little concerned, but after reading some of the online "pro-family" news sources, I discovered it was just all of Canada's _traditional families_ exploding.

As it turns out, an Ontario judge ruled that a child's biological father was permitted to be a legal guardian alongside his adoptive lesbian mothers. In short: this kid has two mommies and one daddy.

Of course, that nutty anti-gay lobby was quick to go into assault mode, quickly crafting a connection between Wednesday's ruling and same-sex marriage. Dave Quist, head of the Institute of Marriage and Family Canada, said the government needs to "hit the pause button" on same-sex marriage and launch a royal commission to study the state of the family in Canada. Former MP, Pat O'brien, was a tad more dramatic, asking: "Words like mother, father, marriage---could they become meaningless?"

Such concern. Could "mother," "father," and "marriage" become meaningless words? Like "zooberblab," "gafungwa," and... "pro-family?"

I'll alert the dictionary people. Just to be safe.

But, in the meantime... Why such a reaction? Could the anti-gay lobby's objections that same-sex marriage denies children of their biological parents really just have been a red herring to cover the fact they're really just not too fond of gays? (_Shock horror!_)

And couldn't this three-parent situation have just as easily happened to an opposite-sex parent family that relied on an in-vitro donor? Why is same-sex marriage even entering the picture? You know, 'cause perhaps---just perhaps---families are classified into more than just _traditional_ and _ungodly homosexual fakers_.

Well, have a great weekend, kids!
