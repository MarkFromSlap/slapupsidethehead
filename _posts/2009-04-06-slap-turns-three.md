![Slappy Birthday to me, Slappy birthday to me...]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/04/slappy-birthday-2009.png' | relative_url}} "Slappy Birthday to me, Slappy birthday to me...")

It's barely believable to me, but yesterday was  **Slap Upside The Head**'s third birthday! If this site were a person, it'd be walking about comfortably and have a pretty decent vocabulary.

To help commemorate Slap's blogoversary, my wonderful, talented, smart, and incredibly handsome fiance let me take a break from the computer by preparing this delicious virtual cake in Google Sketchup. (The website think's it's delicious and sends its thanks.)

Of course, there wouldn't be a website if it weren't for all the readers and supporters out there. You're what keeps this site alive. Thank you all!
