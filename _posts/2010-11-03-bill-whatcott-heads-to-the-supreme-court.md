![Next up on Whatcott Brain-o-Vision: GAY! GAY! GAY! Followed by: GAAAAAAAAAAAY!]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/11/whatcott-brain-o-vision.jpg' | relative_url}} "You're watching Whatcott Brain-o-Vision: All gay, all the time.")

Bill Whatcott, Canada's most strangely obsessed anti-gay activist, will soon be the subject of quizzical contemplation by Canada's highest court.

Whatcott was fined nearly a decade ago after distributing hateful, anti-gay fliers in Saskatchewan, but [won an appeals court ruling](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2010/03/anti-gay-crusader-wins-court-challenge/ "Ugh.") in February on the grounds that distributing fliers is part of his freedom of expression.

The fliers really weren't very nice. "Our children," one pamphlet reads in part, "will pay the price in disease, death, abuse and ultimately eternal judgement if we do not say no to the sodmoite desire to socialize your children into accepting something that is clearly wrong."

"Sodomites," another read, "are 430 times more likely to acquire AIDS and three times more likely to sexually abuse children."

It should go without saying that all the pamphlets were really, really, _really_ wrong---factually and morally. So, unhappy with the appeals court ruling, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Comission asked the Supreme Court to visit the case, and they agreed.

Now, having the same level of legal understanding as... let's say a massive, multinational corporation, I remain utterly clueless as to what the Supreme Court will find. Personally, I feel that freedom of expression is an important right, but I don't think that necessarily means you can go around making all sorts of wacky, unfounded accusations that gay people are bringing about the children apocalypse. Sounds a lot like slandering an entire minority to me, and I hope that's what Canada's provisions against inciting hatred are meant to prohibit.

One thing's pretty clear to me, though. This guy is _gay-obsessed_. I mean, I'm actually gay and I still don't have as much gay-on-the-brain as this guy. Off the top of my head: In addition to crafting and distributing hysterically nutty pamphlets, Whatcott once lead Regina's Gay Pride parade with anti-gay signage, [picketted](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/anti-gay-nurse-suspended/ "He does like his picket signs") outside private Planned Parenthood clinics declaring the workers there to be "disseminators of AIDS," and even [ran for mayor of Edmonton](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/06/mayor-of-edmonton/ "He, uh, lost.") with a completely anti-gay platform. "As your mayor," his official platform opened, "Bill Whatcott is committed to protecting Edmontonians from homofascism."

Right. Well, here's hoping the Supreme Court will protect us from whatcottcrazyism!
