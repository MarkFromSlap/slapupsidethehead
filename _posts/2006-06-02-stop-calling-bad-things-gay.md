![That's so gay](/wp-content/media/2006/06/so_gay.jpg)

Using the phrase "that's so gay" to mean "that's horrible" has become unacceptably common, the [Greater Victoria School District](http://www.sd61.bc.ca/ "The GVSD... An unpronouncable acronym") announced last month. And now they're doing something about it!

Armed with the slogan "That's so gay is not OK," school trustees launched a campaign aimed at getting students to think about what they say. Sara Bisson, a grade 11 student, agrees with the plan and thinks students don't always realise they're being hurtful.

> They don't really mean it in a homophobic way, it's just said in a derogatory way and if you confront someone and say, "do you realize what you're saying," they usually say, "oh, but I didn't mean it like that."

Regardless of how successful the program turns out to be, it's a positive step. Now, if only we could get the anti-gays to realise that "you're evil and God hates you" is also irrationally hateful, we'd be all set!
