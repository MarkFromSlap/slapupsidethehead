![This makes very little sense, but so does the California ruling.](/wp-content/media/2009/05/california-consolation.jpg "This really doesn't make sense, but then again neither does the California ruling.")

Well, the big news is no doubt yesterday's decision by the California Supreme Court that [Proposition 8](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/11/proposition-8-is-discriminatory-nonsense/ "And you're always welcome in Canada, if no where else!"), a referendum banning same-sex marriage in the state, is a legally valid constitutional amendment. While I'm disappointed, I'm not sure I can add to what many other commentators have put more eloquently than I could.

All I can say is to keep up the fight. Equality is not inevitable; it must be fought for, and I wish California all the best in overturning Prop 8 in the next referendum!
