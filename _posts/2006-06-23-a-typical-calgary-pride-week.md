![Pride Parade]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/06/pride_parade.jpg' | relative_url}})

Calgary's police chief, Jack Beaton, warned anti-gay protesters that "there's such a thing as provocation" last week, after a protester who chased and called a gay man a "_disgusting homo_" was given a hefty, retaliatory tackle.

While the tackling was, of course, rightfully condemned, the police chief's warning isn't going over well with some of the protesters. Jeff Willerton, who was holding a quaint little "No Pride in Sodomy" sign that day, published an open letter on Wednesday, stating that not only were his slurs "in no way considered hateful" (_chortle_), but also that he thinks _his group_ was the one provoked. The poor dears! Unwillingly incited into crafting offensive signs and yelling slurs!

Observe their rationale:

> Two men spit at us, missing me but hitting my friend. This caused a great deal of concern for my friend, who knows that AIDS-infected spit in the eye or in an open sore can lead to the transmission of the disease.

_Oh, Snap! Seriously._ All us gays must be like _walking rainbows of death_---ready to infect anyone who crosses our path of gayness with [the GRIDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIDS "That's what it used to be called, really!")! Run for the hills!

Incidentally, Tyson McCann Cormack, the spitter, had this to say:

> I was chased and yelled at and I've never done anything my whole life. Well, I was tired of it today. I went to spit near one guy, but I did not spit on him. I spat near him as a sign that I wasn't impressed with [the slurs].

But, really, although the protesters were clearly being jerks, that doesn't exonerate a physical attack. After all, no matter how hurtful the "pro-family" types can be---no matter how much they go out of their way to personally insult us gays on our only day of celebration---I only dole out _metaphorical_ slaps. It's just the cordial thing to do.
