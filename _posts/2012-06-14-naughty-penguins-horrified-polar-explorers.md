A century-old academic paper labelled "Not for publication" has been discovered at the Natural History Museum in Tring, England. The paper, written by a polar explorer in 1915, observes---with _horror_---the [deviant and immoral sex lives of Ad√©lie penguins](http://m.yahoo.com/w/legobpengine/news/penguins-explicit-sex-acts-shocked-polar-explorer-125137476.html). The naughty, naughty penguins were described as having "autoerotic tendencies" as well as partaking in "non-procreative sex and homosexual behaviors." Of course we may rest assured that these penguins are probably long dead and are now suffering eternity in penguin hell (which is a little like Hawaii, but is assuredly considered quite insufferable to polar waterfowl).
