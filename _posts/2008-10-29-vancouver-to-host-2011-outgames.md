![](/wp-content/media/2008/10/outgames-coin-toss.jpg "Close enough to the official procedure, I think.")

Here's some good news for all the gay althetes out there. Vancouver has been selected as the host city for the 2011 North American Continental OutGames. Canada's third-largest city, which is also is hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics, will be well-equipped to accommodate the events and athletes with some brand-new facilities.

Canada's no stranger to the OutGames. The first World OutGames were [held in Montr√©al](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/visa-delays/ "I have such fond memories of the men's diving competition...") in 2006, and the first North American Continental OutGames were [held in Calgary](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/continental-outgames-gets-unlikely-host/ "That wacky, wacky city."). Vancouver's announcement means Canada will have played host to exactly half of all OutGames thus far, including those in which it's ineligible to host (The Asia Pacific Continental OutGames). Just another plus to living in an [officially homosexual country](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/10/canada-officially-a-homosexual-country/ "What gay things will we do next?")!
