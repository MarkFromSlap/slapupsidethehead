High school students in Abbotsford, British Columbia, have run into opposition for their plans to hold the town's first gay pride parade in November. The idea for the parade was prompted in part by the local school board's decision to [turf a social justice course over gay content](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/09/social-justice-course-yanked-by-religious-groups/ "Lest the students catch ").

Drawing quotes from a Facebook Group called _1,000 People Against the Pride Parade for Abbotsford_, The Province reported that opponents criticized the parade as being an "attention-seeking gesture rather than a legitimate social cause."

Yeah, so here's the thing: If a minority group's small-town, cultural parade is drawing enough criticism to prompt Facebook opposition groups and media attention, then it's a _ **freakin' legitimate social cause. Gee whiz.** _
