![A man is being filmed while misreading an](/wp-content/media/2011/10/it-gets-butter.jpg "I can't believe it's not better.")

Canada's own Rick Mercer posted a [particularly good Rick Mercer Rant last week](http://youtu.be/Wh1jNAZHKIw "That means you should watch it now."), prompted in part by the Conservative Party's ill-thought-out and poorly timed [contribution to the It Gets Better project](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/10/tories-release-it-gets-better-video/ "Tories Release â€œIt Gets Betterâ€ Video").

The rant quickly gained viral status online with its simple message: It's not enough to just say "It gets better" and leave it at that. Actions need to be taken, and---in particular---GLBT youth need visible role models as proof. (Rick's looking at _you_, John Baird.)

This message---that things need to get better sooner through action---is the most important part of the It Gets Better project, but it's overlooked far too often as the Tory video aptly demonstrates. Repeating via script that things get better isn't much consolation for tortured youth. Without action, telling kids to hang tough through several years of constant harassment dismisses homophobia and bullying as being some unameliorable aspect of school life.

Make things get better; action doesn't have to be difficult. Challenge homophobia wherever you witness it. Write to your MLA and local school boards to encourage anti-homophobia policies. Vote against [ignorant groups](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/10/parents-start-new-party-against-school-anti-bullying-policies/ "Parents Start New Party Against School Anti-Bullying Policies") that try to keep GLBT students invisible. Support and encourage GSAs. If you're a gay adult, be open and honest in all aspects of your life so that you and your accomplishments can serve as a visible example for others.

Things already get better---but lets help ensure it never starts off bad in the first place.
