The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has [launched a formal objection](http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-business/3375984/gay-wine-porn-sexy-among-gtlds-objected-by-saudi-arabia/) to a proposed kind of website address ending in .gay. The complaint asserts that the new top level domain name would offend their culture. Personally, I just wonder what the difference between google.com and google.gay would be. Perhaps the logo would be even more rainbowy.
