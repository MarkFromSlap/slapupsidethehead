Yesterday, a house committee in Oklahoma [rejected a horrendously anti-gay bill](http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/oklahoma-house-committee-rejects-anti-lgbt-bill) that would have made it legal to fire state municipal employees just for being gay. The bill was introduced by lawmaker Mike Reynolds, who is now officially so homophobic that even _Oklahoma_ thinks he has gone to far.
