![A man looks very happy while eating his breakfast in front of the television.]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/04/chch-porn-news.jpg' | relative_url}} "Good morning!")

Television viewers in Hamilton, Ontario last week found their breakfast interrupted (_enhanced?_) by nearly three minutes of "eye-popping hardcore gay pornography."

The mihap, which happened around 9:30 a.m. Friday during the CHCH morning news show, is reportedly the result of severed cable lines outside of the station's control that had been spliced back together incorrectly. As a result, viewers were treated to a free viewing of Lucas Entertainment's _After Hours_ instead of their usual morning news chatter.

When normal broadcasting finally resumed, the station's news anchors and management issued an apology: "We'd like to apologize to some of our cable viewers for the inappropriate content that aired around 9:30 this morning."

It actually makes a lot of sense that they'd only apologize to "some" of their viewers, because I can assure you no apology would be necessary in _my_ household!

The CRTC, Canada's broadcast regulation agency, says they've received three complaints over the incident. They are now investigating to determine which cable company was responsible for the mixup and will prepare a report outlining the steps that will be put in place to ensure it doesn't happen again.

Hmm... I wonder how this would play out if the incident happened in the uptight United States?
