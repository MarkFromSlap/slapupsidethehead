Poor James Loney. The Roman Catholic peace activist and former Iraqi hostage has been booted from [yet another](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/church-rescinds-peace-funding/ "So that's what Jesus would do!") Church-sponsored shindig because he's gay.

Archbishop James Weisgerber uninvited Loney from speaking at a social justice conference this weekend after the Campaign Life Coalition lobbied to have him nixed. Maria Slykerman, head of the right-wing organisation, urged parishioners to call and write the Archibishop, calling the guest speaker an "unrepentant, active homosexual."

Loney was to speak on the subject of peace and justice. _Irronnyyyy..._

While Loney said he respectfully disagrees with the Archibishop's decision, other speakers weren't quite as forgiving. Nerina and John Robson, two of the conference organizers and scheduled speakers, have dropped out. When contacted by the press, Nerina was frank and honest about her withdrawl: "How can I speak at a conference on social justice when it is committing such an unjust action?"
