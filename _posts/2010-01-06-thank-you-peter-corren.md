I was saddened to learn that Canada has lost one of its most influential gay rights activists over the holiday.

Peter Corren died last week after a long battle with cancer. He fought several important court and human rights cases alongside his husband and longtime partner, Murray Corren. The court cases were often funded out of their own pocket and helped gay people all across Canada gain adoption rights, marriage rights, and anti-discrimination policies in schools.

Both of the Correns were often maligned by opponents of equal rights for gays and lesbians, particularly over exaggerations regarding a curriculum review to ensure anti-discrimination practices in British Columbia schools. Despite suffering through abusive calls and death threats, the Correns have helped shape Canada as a place where gay people can feel safer and be treated as equals.

Thank you Peter, for your courage and compassion, and my sincerest condolences to Murray and the rest of Peter's family, who have lost much more than a hero.
