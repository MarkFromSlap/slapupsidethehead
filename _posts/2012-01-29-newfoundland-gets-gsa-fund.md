Looks like Ontario may need to go to Newfoundland for some schooling on schooling. Clyde Jackman, Newfoundland's education minister, [just announced MyGSA](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2012/01/24/nl-gay-alliances-124.html "Myguhssah"), a $90,000 fund to help support the establishment of Gay-Straight Alliances. And it's available to _all_ schools offering grades 7 to 12. Cool stuff! It's about time tha---Hey, _McGuinty!_ Pay attention! Is that gum?
