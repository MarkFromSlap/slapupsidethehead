![Government Wikipedia Vandal](/wp-content/media/2007/08/wikipedia-vandal.jpg)

Office computers belonging to the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa have been used to vandalize [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) articles with anti-gay comments. (Wikipedia, for the benefit of the recently non-comatose, is an online encyclopedia to which anyone can contribute.)

A reporter for the St. Catharine's Standard found several anti-gay themed edits---including one asserting that a Conservative MP who voted in favour of same-sex marriage was gay himself, and another declaring that Mussolini and Hitler were gay lovers.

A [quick search](http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/f.php?ip1=192.197.77.0-192.197.86.255&ip2=&ip3=&ip4=&nolimit=1 "Government edits galore!") using the [Wikipedia Scanner](http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/ "This could get interesting!") revealed even more Parliament edits. [One in particular](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Members_of_the_39th_Canadian_Parliament_and_same-sex_marriage&diff=prev&oldid=76635862 "Our money at work"), made to an article entitled [Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_39th_Canadian_Parliament_and_same-sex_marriage "People still continue to edit this one?"), replaced the unbiased phrase "opposite-sex marriage" with "normal and traditional marriage," and the phrase "an anti- gay marriage website had indicated [...]" with "a real marriage website had indicated [...]" The vandal also inserted a new sentence into the article: "However, it seems that the Canadian public is still firmly against same-sex marriage by a large majority." A [demonstrably false](http://www.equal-marriage.ca/resource.php?id=514 "Canada is largely tolerant") claim.

Each instance of vandalism was reverted almost immediately, as is the Wikipedia norm, but it's great to know what our Government workers do with ~~their~~ our time, no?
