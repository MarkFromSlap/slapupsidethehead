Great news coming out of Iceland this month, as it became the ninth country in the world to offer full marriage equality to all its citizens! The parliamentary vote passed unanimously, 49 to 0, making Iceland join the ranks of Canada, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Sweden in legalizing same-sex marriage.

This is fantastic news, although I'm a little surprised it didn't happen earlier. I mean, what with BjÃ¶rk and all.

Iceland also made international news in 2009 after electing Johanna Sigurdardottir, the [world's first gay leader](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/02/worlds-first-openly-gay-leader-is-a-big-deal/ "A big deal!").
