![So very tragic.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/10/transgender-teacher.jpg' | relative_url}} "So very tragic.")

The St. Albert Catholic School Board has fired a transgendered substitute teacher for being, well, transgenered.

The teacher's union representing Mr. Jan Buterman has filed a human rights complaint over the firing, with incontrovertible evidence of workplace discrimination. "Since you made a personal choice to change your gender," a letter received from the school board to Mr. Buterman reads, "we have to remove you from the substitute teacher list." The letter adds that "the teaching of the Catholic Church is that persons cannot change their gender."

Gee, they sure go through a lot of trouble to make sure students never have contact with any GLBT role models. I mean, can you imagine what would happen to the students if that were to happen? Surely one shudders at the very thought!

Say... You know, the name of the school board sounds awfully familiar to me... Oh, that's right! It's the one in which I spent my _entire grade school education_. Funny, I still turned out gay.

Now, normally religious institutions are exempt from following human rights laws, but the St. Albert Catholic School Board is publicly funded which throws a bit of a kink into that argument. I don't know how this human rights complaint will turn out, mind you. Alberta technically does not recognize transgendered individuals in its human rights legislation (and consequently [tramples over them whenever possible](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/04/alberta-fixes-the-economy/ "The economy is now solved.")), but I would hope that either the board follows the same, respectful antidiscrimination laws that other publicly funded institutions are required to follow, or find private sources of funding.
