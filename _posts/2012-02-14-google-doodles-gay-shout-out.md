Google has [posted a Valentine's Day video](http://youtu.be/WTGUjRJiqik "Their annual Google Doodle") on their home page, and it includes an adorable gay couple near the end. Aw, how sweet! That couple, though, is displayed in a visual collage alongside other "non-traditional" pairings such as a dog and a cat, a cookie embracing some milk, and an astronaut holding hands with an alien. Uh... thanks?
