![A lawyer brings some good news]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/05/supreme_court.jpg' | relative_url}})

Think you can be too old for a lengthy court battle? Think again! George Hislop's class-action suit to receive same-sex survivor benefits will face the Supreme Court of Canada tomorrow. The kicker? If Hislop gets to keep his partner's pension, he won't be able to enjoy it; he died in October at 78.

To make matters _even more_ interesting, the federal government is actually **fighting** the deceased's cause, saying it could set a precedent and cost taxpayers $80,000,000 or more. This is, of course, glossing over the fact that this figure (hmm... heavily inflated, you think?) was pretty much paid for by the same-sex couples themselves, through years and years of payments into the Canada Pension Plan. You know, because they just _loved_ paying money into plans that only heterosexuals can benefit from.

Luckily, Doug Elliot, the lawyer representing Hislop, is painting a more realistic picture for the misguided feddies.

> There would be no significant impact on the CPP---no increase in premiums or on benefits paid to anyone else. But the extra monthly support would make a huge difference for several claimants who desperately need it.

Well, a huge difference to the non-deceased claimants, at least. Although, I guess the estates of the others could always decorate up their headstones a little...
