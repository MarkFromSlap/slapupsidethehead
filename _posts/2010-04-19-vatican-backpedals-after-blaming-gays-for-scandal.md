![Brain leaves Vatican official for greener pastures.](/wp-content/media/2010/04/vatican-claims.jpg "Brain may be larger in illustration than real life.")

The Vatican released a statement on Friday asserting that their officials are not "competent" to talk about psychological matters. The unusual (but fair) assessment came after one of their cardinals, Tarcisio Bertone, declared---without sound reference---that homosexuality, and not mandated celibacy, was responsible for the church's paedophilia scandal. ([No link between paedophilia and homosexuality](http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/Articles/000,002.htm "An excellent survey of current research into the matter.") has ever been demonstrated.)

The comments received massive condemnation from governments and gay rights groups, including Canada's own Egale. And from me too, why not? Because unjustly blaming an already tortured minority in order to divert responsibility for this horrific cover-up is... well, about exactly what I'd come to expect from the Vatican.
