![Bill Whatcott Fliers](/wp-content/media/2007/03/whatcott-fliers.jpg)

Remember Bill Whatcott? His hysterical anti-gay stance has won him repeated [human rights violations](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/11/human-rights-fine/ "Slow learner I guess") and a [job suspension](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/anti-gay-nurse-suspended/ "Helllooooo delusional nurse!"), but that doesn't seem to stop him from distributing hate literature. Now a local activist group might have him re-thinking his strategy.

Amber Fletcher from the [Campus Feminist Action Network](http://cfanregina.blogspot.com/ "They also support GLBT rights") in Regina, Saskatchewan wrote in to announce a delightfully clever pledge drive:

> We would like to collect pledges for each leaflet Whatcott distributes from now on, and donate that money to local GLBT groups.
> 
> If he continues, the GLBT centres will benefit, and we will have succeeded.

Outstanding! If you'd like to make a pledge and help out some worthy organisations, check out the [CFAC](http://cfanregina.blogspot.com/ "A novel pledge idea") website for upcoming details.
