Alvaro Orozco, a gay refugee facing deportation to Nicaragua, is struggling to remain in Canada after his home country has started the process to decriminalize gay sex. While the reversal of Nicaragua's invasive and discriminatory law is ultimately good news for gays in the country, homophobia and violence remains a problem.

Alvaro seeked Canadian citizenship after escaping Nicaragua at the age of 12 because his father beat him for being gay. His Calgarian adjudicator, Deborah Lamont, ordered his deportation, insisting that Alvaro [failed to prove he was gay](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/not-gay-enough/).

El-Farouk Khaki, Alvaro's lawyer, said that repealing a gay sex ban won't ensure the safety of his client:

> The reality is that many queer people around the world still get persecuted in countries where homosexuality is not necessarily illegal. You have to take a look at societal attitudes and the police.

For more information on Alvaro and what you can do to help stop his deportation, read Ed Lee's two-part [guest post](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/09/refugee-needs-support/) on Slap, which includes [a plea from Alvaro himself](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/09/gay-refugee-speaks/).
