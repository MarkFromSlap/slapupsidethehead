It's hard to believe, but today is  **Slap Upside The Head**'s fourth birthday!

Yes, it has been a full four years since the [very first Slap post](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/04/brigitte-bardot-pleads-to-canadians/ "It's about Brigitte Bardot, for some reason.") was published on April 5<sup><small>th</small></sup>, 2006. And, to commemorate, here is some Slap-themed wallpaper! Take your pick:

- [Widescreen Edition](/wp-content/media/2010/04/slap-wallpaper.jpg "It's wider than the largest rainbow!") (1920 Ã— 1080, 257 KB)
- [Not-So-Widescreen Edition](/wp-content/media/2010/04/slap-wallpaper-fullscreen.jpg "It's narrower than the minds of the world's worst bigots!") (1280 Ã— 960, 190 KB)
