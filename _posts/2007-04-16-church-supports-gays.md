[Scott Tribe](http://scottdiatribe.gluemeat.com/2007/04/15/us-branch-of-anglican-church-takes-a-stand-for-gay-rights-canada-expected-to-follow/) writes in with an interesting story: The U.S. Episcopal Church has voted to face expulsion from the Anglican hierarchy rather than reject gay rights. The Anglican Church [issued an ultimatum](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/church-threatened-shutdown/) in February for what it called "errant" churches, which support gay clergy and bless same-sex marriages.

The Canadian Anglicans are expected to vote to let each parish decide whether or not to accept or reject the ultimatum in June. Retired archbishop Terrance Finlay, who [was suspended](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/church-suspends-archibishop/) in October for officiating over a gay wedding, encouraged the church to follow the U.S. example:

> Be willing to risk the cause of love over institutionalism.

Well said!
