![Court Challenges Ejection](/wp-content/media/2008/07/court-challenges-ejection.jpg "A very ad siuaion.")

The Court Challenges Program, a means to ensure that unconstitutional laws could be challenged by those who otherwise couldn't afford it, was [scrapped by the Federal Tories](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/tories-cut-equality-funding/ "Because protecting the people isn't the role of the government so much as controlling them?") in 2006. The program, which cost a pittance, was cut largely due to [lobbying from anti-gay groups](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/go-fund-yourself/ "Rights only for the self-righteous") who were angry that the program was helping to strike down laws that illegally infringed upon gay rights.

Due to an out-of-court settlement with the Federation de Communautes Francophone et Acadienne du Canada, the program appears to be making a comeback. Sadly, it's not without some major changes to fit in with the ideological reasons why the program was cut in the first place.

The first change is the name: It's now called the _Program to Support Linguistic Rights_. The second change is exactly what the name implies: It's exclusively to support linguistic rights, and not the rights of everyone. This means that there still will not be a way to challenge illegal laws that infringe upon minority rights without having deep pockets.

Helen Kennedy, a spokesperson for the gay rights group Egale, expressed disappointment in the replacement:

> [The Tories] are ranking minorities. How do you place precedence of one group over another?
> 
> This is really a problem and I think that we've seen a slow, subtle erosion of LGBT rights since the Tories came to power. This is a very subtle way of denying us access to the justice system.

In 2007, opposition leader [Stephen Dion vowed to ressurrect](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/04/ressurecting-court-challenges-program/ "No relation to CÃ©line Dion, thankfully.") the Court Challenges Program as it existed before it was cut.
