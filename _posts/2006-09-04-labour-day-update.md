Ah, Labour Day, the ironically named holiday where we get absolutely no work done. And, of course, this site is no exception. _However_, I've prepared this lovely **Labour Day Update** in advance, especially for you!

So, without further ado...

## Take _THAT_, Teddy!

The _amazingly_ bigoted Alberta MLA, Ted Morton, was dealt a sweet, justice-ey blow last week, as his hate-filled [Bill 208](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/08/bill-208-is-back/ "It's like nine different kinds of hate rolled into one!") was [mercilessly killed](http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=4db57e02-7bdd-48fc-88b5-de2a79c91744&k=34814 "Rest in pieces!") by necessary opposition delay tactics. The bill would have permitted civil marriage commissioners to deny their public service to gays, forced teachers to "warn" parents before even acknowledging the existence of same-sex marriage in Canada, and remove all consequences for an individual "exercising their beliefs" against same-sex marriage. Ah, just think: waiters refusing to serve gay couples, bus drivers refusing to let them board public transit... How uniquely _Alberta_! (And _mind-numbingly_ unconstitutional.)

And, I guess that's it for the Labour Day Update. Just one story. Well, until Wednesday, folks, don't labour _too_ much!
