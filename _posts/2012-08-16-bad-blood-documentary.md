[Bad Blood](http://Facebook.com/BadBloodDoc), a documentary film about the ban on blood donations from gay men, looks like it's well worth checking out. Although I have to wonder... If Canadian Blood Services were to screen the documentary like they screen their blood, do you think they'd give it zero stars even if it passed the advance screening surveys? You know, because the director is gay.
