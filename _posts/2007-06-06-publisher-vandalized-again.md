Poor [Capital Xtra](http://www.xtra.ca/public/main.aspx?AFF_TYPE=2 "A great little mag"). The popular gay community newspaper just can't get a break from vandalism. In the past few years, their distribution boxes have been spray painted, covered in slurs, bolted shut, [robbed](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/01/vandal-attacks-publisher/ "Nothing says "), [illegally removed from public facilities](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/03/ottawa-pulls-newspaper/ "Won't someone think of the children!?"), and now burned!

Over the Victoria Day long weekend, a vandal set fire to some of the magazine's distribution boxes, ruining about 80 issues and damaging the metal and plexiglas.

In response to the continued defacements, the magazine has started a "very informal" adopt-a-box program. Each of the adorable purple boxes will get a reader volunteer to check up on it from time to time. As with real children, adoptive parents are to report back if their baby gets spray painted, covered in slurs, bolted shut, robbed, illegally removed from public facilities, or burned.
