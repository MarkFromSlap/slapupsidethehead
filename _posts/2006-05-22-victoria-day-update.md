![It's Queen Victoria!]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/05/victoria_day.jpg' | relative_url}})

Well, I'm off enjoying [Victoria Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Day "Because us gays love a good queen!") today---the day where Canadians _everywhere_ thank [Queen Victoria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom "I really don't know much about her; but this is where you can learn") for... whatever she did to give us a national holiday in her honour. In the meantime, though, I've prepared this special _Victoria Day Update_ to let you, the astute reader, know what has been happening with some of those wacky stories I've been reporting on.

![Gotta wait a little longer...]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/05/court_delay.jpg' | relative_url}})

I assume it must be _really_ hard to translate "gays deserve equal treatment" into legalese, because the Supreme Court's decision on whether or not to give retroactive [survivor's benefits](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/15/pension-battle/ "Read about it, why not?") to same-sex couples has been [delayed](http://www.hamiltonspectator.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=hamilton/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1147816221752&call_pageid=1020420665036&col=1112101662670 "Gee whiz..."). I guess there's no pressure for them to hurry up, though; the main claimant died in October waiting for a ruling.

Poor [King Ralph](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/04/ralph-to-leave-throne/ "He's leaving his throne, apparently, eventually...") and Ted Morton! Their beloved [Bill 208](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/anti-gay-bill-targets-teachers/ "Click here, if you enjoy reading about annoying temper tantrums")---which would have allowed Alberta teachers to not only _refuse to acknowledge the existence of same-sex marriage_ in Canada, but also force them to send out **parental warnings** before speaking a word on the subject---was [effectively killed](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060508/klein_gays_060508/20060508?hub=Canada "Hooray for sanity!") in parliament through brilliant opposition delay tactics. Now, I wonder if they'll be able to effectively kill Ted and Ralphy's temper tantrum?
