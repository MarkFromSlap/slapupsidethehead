![UN Consultive Status](/wp-content/media/2007/07/consultive-status.jpg)

After being initially [rejected](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/un-rejects-gays/), the [Coalition gaie et lesbienne du Québec](http://www.cglq.org/ "Mille mercis") (CGLQ) has finally been granted consultive status at the UN.

By a vote of 22 countries in support to 13 against, CGLQ will now be able to access UN buildings, attend meetings, submit reports, and address the UN in ways otherwise impossible. The group will use this opportunity to educate and speak out against attrocities committed against gays worldwide.

Alongside CGLQ, [The Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights](http://www.rfsl.se/?p=3298 "I don't know much about them, but congratulations!") (RFSL) was also granted consultive status, though an extra country voted against them.

Say, what do they have against the Swedish?
