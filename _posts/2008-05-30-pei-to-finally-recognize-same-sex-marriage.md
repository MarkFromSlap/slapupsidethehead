No, that's not an old headline or a misprint. Prince Edward Island, the place that brought us [the book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_green_gables "Would it be hypocritical if I called this book ") that inspired just about every gay bed and breakfast out there, is _finally_ updating the law books to officially recognize same-sex marriages.

P.E.I. was one of only two provinces in Canada to deny same-sex marriage before the federal Bill C-32 was passed in 2005. After that, gay people could get married in the province, but they didn't have the same legal status as opposite-sex unions. All of that's changing with the introduction of new legislation that passed through all three readings on Wednesday.

Attorney General Gerard Greenan responded to questions of why the process took so long:

> Honestly, it certainly was a task. It took seven months to put this bill into place.

Well, that, and I guess an additional two-and-a-half years to take their eyes off the breathtaking scenery and start the process in the first place. It's the P.E.I. curse, I suppose.

So, to all the happily married couples in P.E.I., congratulations on officially getting your hospital visitation and power of attorney rights!
