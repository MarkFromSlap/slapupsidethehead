![OMG, The Mayor!]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/04/cardston_crazies.jpg' | relative_url}})

Well, it's not every day that I get to slap an entire town upside the head. But, lo! [The Town of Cardston, Alberta](http://www.town.cardston.ab.ca/ "The Town of Cardston, Population: Who Cares?") (population: 3,500), made famous for it's carriage museum [featured on The Simpsons](http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2006/04/13/carriage-museum.html "Oooh! Hollywood took notice!") two weeks ago, has sent a formal letter requesting support for a ban on same-sex marriage. And to whom was this letter addressed? Why, the powerful [Municipality of Crowsnest Pass](http://www.town.crowsnestpass.ab.ca/ "Finally, a small town with some sense") (population: 6000), of course!

Unfortunately for Cardston, representatives for Crowsnest Pass were quick to pooh-pooh the notion, noting that not only do they unanimously oppose a ban on gay nuptials, but also that a ban would be illegal, as marriage is entirely federal jurisdiction. Yeah, all the way to the _prime minister_! Nonetheless, Cardston remains undeterred.

> In schools are [sic] children are being taught that same gender marriages are a 'normal' lifestyle. Our Council feels that the silent majority needs to stand and be counted in regards to this manner.

Ah, you Cardston crazies. Crowsnest Pass shot you down, but with the _Mayor of Cardston_'s weight behind you, there's nothing you can't accomplish! Well, except maybe this... and, uh, pretty much anything else of significance.
