The city of Lethbridge, Alberta has been [plastered with homophobic and racist graffiti](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2012/08/11/calgary-racist-graffiti-lethbridge.html), resulting in a citywide cleanup effort. Still, the fact that this story actually made national news is a pretty good indicator of the awesome progress being made in Canada, don't you think?
