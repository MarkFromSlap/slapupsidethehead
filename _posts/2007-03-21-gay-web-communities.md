![Domain Name Registration](/wp-content/media/2007/03/domain-name-registration.jpg)

Given the rate that .com names are snaffled up, wouldn't it be cool if gay-friendly websites could be registered in a special ".gay" community? Well, don't count on it!

Due to increasing political pressure, [ICANN](http://www.icann.org/ "Yes, I can!"), the organisation responsible for domain name policies, is introducing severe new restrictions on what words can be used for top-level domain names. In particular, if even one country objects to a certain word or phrase, then that term would be **banned from use** until that country's government is satisfied. But, hey, I'm sure international grievances are resolved quickly nowadays, right?

So, which countries might object to "slapupsidethehead.gay?" I guess I could think of [at least one](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/anything-gay-outlawed/ "Think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy thoughts!")...
