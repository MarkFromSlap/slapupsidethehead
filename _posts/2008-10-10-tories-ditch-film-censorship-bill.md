The federal Conservatives have withdrawn [a film censorship clause](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/03/film-censorship-bill/ "WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!?") from bill C-10. The clause, which would have allowed the government to withdraw tax credits to films and television shows that they deem "contrary to public policy," was dropped amidst declining support in the polls during the election.

Evangelical lobbyist, Charles McVety, originally claimed responsibility for the clause, indicating that that any films with gay content, such as the [sweet family comedy, _Breakfast With Scot_](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/04/no-credits-for-gay-comedy/ "Unless you're one of those people that think gays don't have families"), would be among those ineligible for tax credits.

While I'm happy that the clause has been turfed, I wouldn't doubt for a second that the Tories would introduce it again, or would have even turfed it if their poll support hadn't been slipping.

They just _really_ don't want _Slap Upside The Head: The Film_ to see the light of day!
