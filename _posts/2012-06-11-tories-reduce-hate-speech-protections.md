The federal Conservatives [quietly removed protections](http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/news/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com/2012/06/07/tories-repeal-sections-of-human-rights-act-banning-hate-speech-over-telephone-or-internet) against hate speech from Canada's Human Rights Act last week, stripping Human Rights Commissions of their power to investigate hatred or violence incited against identifiable minorities. The first sign that this _might_ not have been a good idea: White supremacists immediately [celebrated](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mobileweb/2012/06/08/bill-c-304-hate-speech-tories_n_1581437.html).
