In my web travels, I often collect stories that I _intend_ to share, but then become distracted by newer, shinier stories---or feel too lazy to illustrate them individually. This is what becomes of those stories: a **[Pile o' Slaps](/category/pile-o-slaps/ "Part five of the ongoing saga, like sands in the hourglass...")**!

Montreal Simon has [an excellent post](http://montrealsimon.blogspot.com/2008/12/hospital-and-homophobes.html "This guy has been on my blogroll for, like, ever---and for good reason.") about an anti-gay group that's [campaigning to have a Pride flag removed](http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/dec/08121505.html "Warning, Warning: Anti-Gay Website Alert!") from the lobby of St. Michael's hospital in Toronto. Now, removing the only symbol that indicates gay people won't be treated differently at the hospital might _sound_ petty, but at least they're consistent and also support the removal of religious symbols from state build---[oh, wait](http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2003/aug/03080803.html "An anti-gay group being hypocritical? Get out of here!").

A gay penguin couple that had been expelled from a zoo in China for stealing heterosexual penguin's eggs has been [allowed back](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1094977/Gay-penguins-expelled-zoo-colony-stealing-eggs-given-look-following-animal-rights-protest.html "However, they will spend time in penguin jail for attempted penguin-napping") after protests from zoo visitors. Zookeepers will give the penguins an egg from an inexperienced mother to try and curb the thefts. Religious penguins are furious, calling gay penguinism unnatural and against the teachings of the penguin bible.

Rufus Wainwright, the popular gay folksinger, is in hot water after an interview in which he [advocated for equal marriage rights by saying](http://www.chartattack.com/news/64154/rufus-wainwright-supports-dog-marriages "With friends like this...") "if you want to marry a dog, why don't you go ahead and marry a dog, I don't care." Well, that ought to convince the religious right to abandon their fight against equal marriage rights. Thanks, Rufus.

United States President-elect, Barack Obama, is being criticised by gay groups after [selecting an anti-gay pastor to preside over his inauguration](http://www.montrealgazette.com/Obama+defends+choice+anti+marriage+pastor/1092526/story.html "Mendin' ties, oh baby, just mendin' ties...") this January. It's not the greatest choice, granted, but I suppose you'd rather have the previous guy as president?

Reuters is announcing, for reasons I don't fully understand, that the recently-opened Shrek musical [has a "gay pride element."](http://www.reuters.com/article/artsNews/idUSTRE4BE0F920081215 "What, is the closing number ") And a religious right boycott will start in 3... 2...

Uruguay's senate has (_snicker_) supposedly [paved the way for same-sex marriage](http://news.theage.com.au/world/uruguay-takes-step-towards-gay-marriage-20081218-7134.html "Don't make fun of their name... don't make fun of their name...") after passing a (_chortle_) law that allows people to legally change their gender. _Tee hee. U-ru-guay._

Finally, and surprisingly, the United States [has refused to sign a UN declaration](http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h1rNjQnbi3UUwYn7JGfk4pLIO6DgD955DD7O1 "SHAME!") opposing the criminalization of homosexuality worldwide. Many U.S. officials had privately expressed concern that signing the declaration would contradict state laws that allow landlords and private employers to discriminate against gay people.  Yeah, why oppose unjust laws abroad if it means facing them at home?

Well, that's it for today's Pile o' Slaps. Have a great weekend, kids!
