The Laurier Institute for the Study of Public Opinion and Policy has released the _shocking_ conclusion of a 36,000-person political study: _Gay people don't vote for the Conservative party!_

I'll... give you a moment to absorb that.

The report, made from data donated by Ipsos Reid, states that only 7.3% of gay men and 10.4% of lesbians voted for the Conservatives in the last federal election, compared to 40.7% of straight men and 32.4% of straight women. More interestingly, though, the study revealed who they did did vote for. Gay men were more likely to vote Liberal, at roughly 40%, while lesbians generally voted for the NDP in the same percentage.

The Tories, who have been completely shaken by these results, have vowed to win back the gay community by purchasing more fashionable and better-fitting sweater vests for all of Harper's future anti-gay press releases.
