![This is also a commentary on the absurdity of buying ice in the winter.](/wp-content/media/2009/01/rainbow-flag-sticker.jpg "This is also a commentary on the absurdity of buying ice in Canada.")

Before the holidays, I linked to an excellent blog post by Montr√©al Simon about St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, and how anti-gay lobbyists had [launched a campaign to tear down the rainbow Pride flag](http://montrealsimon.blogspot.com/2008/12/hospital-and-homophobes.html "Petty much?") that is hung there.

Displaying the rainbow flag or a small rainbow flag sticker is something that many businesses and campuses across Canada choose to do---and many people probably can't imagine the relief that this gesture can bring to a gay person.

Having the rainbow flag sticker affixed to a storefront window or an office door signifies to gay people that we can let our guard down and know that we will be treated fairly. To me, it means I won't have a repeat of my experience at a walk-in clinic where, after answering questions about my sexual health and disclosing my orientation in the process, I was treated with a noticeable disrespect, ordered to have STD tests, and was put on antibiotics without any telltale symptoms---all for an upper leg / groin pain that ultimately turned out to be caused by a cheap, folding office chair.

On campuses across Canada, the rainbow sticker is known as the "[positive space](http://www.positivespace.ubc.ca/ "The UBC has it, those handsome devils")" or "[safe space](http://www.mcgill.ca/queerequity/safespace/ "McGill University has it too.")" program, and the University of Victoria is just the [latest institution to consider it](http://www.martlet.ca/article/6405-uvic-eyes-positive-space "Good for them!"). It's an accurate title for an important program---and it's one that's under relentless attack by anti-gay groups and lobbyists.

In 2004, employees at the Royal Bank of Canada [launched an employee-driven, non-mandatory, safe space program](http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1096670376776_92079576/?hub=Canada "An important gesture to gay people who are entrusting their finances"). It meant that if I needed to go into the bank as a couple for a loan, mortgage, joint account, or other service---I could seek out agents displaying the rainbow sticker and know that I'd be treated with the same respect as any other customer. Almost immediately, The Canadian Family Action Coalition launched a boycott against the Royal Bank, instructing members to close their RBC accounts and send angry letters and phone calls to the company. The bank [panicked and caved](http://www.familyaction.org/Articles/issues/sexuality/rbc-succeeds.htm "An unfortunate response to a petty group"), and all RBC employees were forbidden to display the rainbow sticker.

The pettiness, disingenuity, and hostility toward safe space programs and rainbow flags has been a [sore spot](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/ "Thanks, Mayor of Truro!") for me for quite some time. Anti-gay groups call these programs an endorsement of the homosexual lifestyle---whatever that is---and have the audacity to claim that it's a discriminatory practise: That employees who don't wish to display the sticker would be treated with disrespect (a notion I reject). Yet these groups encourage hostility toward anyone who chooses to display it.

So, if you run a business, or work with customers in an office---consider a simple gesture to signify that you will treat everyone respectfully. Put a rainbow sticker somewhere visible. And if anyone objects, clarify that they are welcome too; that it's just a safe space.
