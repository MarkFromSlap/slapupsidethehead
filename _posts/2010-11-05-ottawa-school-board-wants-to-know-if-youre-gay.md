![Question six: Tell us the secret you're desperately trying to hide from everyone.]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/11/secret-question.jpg' | relative_url}} "Because we totally can't look up statistics ourselves.")

The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board is handing out surveys to each of its students in grades 7 to 12, asking---among other things---whether or not they're gay.

The survey, which is not anonymous, specifically asks "How do you identify your sexual orientation?" The offered choices include: "Bisexual, Gay (male), Heterosexual (straight), Lesbian (female), Queer, Questioning, Transsexual, Two-spirited," and "Prefer not to disclose."

The school board says that knowing the diversity of students will help them correlate it with other data and decide which support avenues and other programs are required.

Well, their heart's in the right place, even if their brain is locked in a committee meeting room, sipping coffee below buzzing fluorescent lights, contemplating even more excruciatingly dull forms for other people to suffer through.

Here's my beef with the survey question. Even if every student answers honestly---and they won't; I wouldn't have in grade 7---it doesn't take a survey to conclude that there are gay students in the system that have unique needs to be addressed through support programs. Gay people represent a consistent proportion of the population, they generally have a harder time fitting in at school, they're more likely to be bullied, and they very much dislike filling out stupid forms. Help 'em out, Ottawa-Careton District School Board!
