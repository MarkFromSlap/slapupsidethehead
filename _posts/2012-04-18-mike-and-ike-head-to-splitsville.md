Mike and Ike, some kind of sentient candy entities with human names, have [apparently split up](http://www.canadianbusiness.com/article/79727--mike-and-ike-announce-split-in-cheeky-ad-campaign) according to marketing material from the Just Born candy company. I didn't even know they were gay. Well, you know what they say: There's plenty of Swedish Fish in the package. Personally, I'm just hoping someone puts an end to the forced racial segregation in boxes of Nerds.
