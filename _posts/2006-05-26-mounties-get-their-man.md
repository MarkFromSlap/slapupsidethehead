Adorable news! The [RCMP](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ "That's Royal Canadian Mounted Police") will be celebrating their first official same-sex marriage ceremony this summer! Longtime couple Const. Jason Tree and Const. David Connors will be exchanging vows in full Mountie getup on June 30th, although they haven't decided if they want an honour guard performed for them.

Even though I've never been a fan of red felt (at least, that's what it looks like those uniforms are made of...), let me be among the first to wish the happy couple years and years of wedded bliss. Just keep an eye out for that mischievous Snidely Whiplash (aka Stephen Harper).
