![Check his pockets for rice!]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/03/wedding-raid.jpg' | relative_url}} "Check his pockets for rice!")

James over at [Gay Persons of Color](http://gay-persons-of-color.blogspot.com/ "Or, for the nitpicky, Gay Persons of ") has [dug up an unreal story](http://gay-persons-of-color.blogspot.com/2009/03/that-open-minded-nigerian-anglican.html "Well, sadly it's actually pretty real") about the Anglican Church of Nigeria and their formal proposal to jail anyone who participates in a gay wedding.

The proposed law, delivered to a parliamentary committee this week, would incarcerate gay couples who get married for five years, as well as any witnesses to the ceremony for one year.

Well...  _Someone's_ awfully cranky.

Many governments worldwide are actively homophobic, but jailing well-wishers who simply attend a gay wedding would, essentially, make it illegal _not_ to be homophobic.

But perhaps there'll be nothing to worry about. As James points out, the proposed law would be entirely moot---at least, according to the government. Just last month, Nigeria's Minister of Foreign Affairs declared that an exhaustive, country-wide search for gays and lesbians had been carried out and that they "could not come across any Nigerian with such sexuality."
