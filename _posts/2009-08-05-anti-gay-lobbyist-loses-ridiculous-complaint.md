![Can this even be called martyrdom?]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/08/kari-simpson.jpg' | relative_url}} "Can this even be called martyrdom?")

Kari Simpson, an anti-gay lobbyist, has lost her Human Rights Complaint [against the B.C. Education Ministry](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/03/anti-gay-human-rights-complaint-is-a-dud/ "No one took up my offer to bet otherwise! "), which she claimed had not done enough to help schoolchildren who "suffer from homosexuality and other dysfunctional sexual orientations."

The amusingly dumb complaint argued that B.C. schools were actively denying students access to "sexual re-orientation therapies."

No such students joined in on her class-action complaint.

The reparative conversion therapy that Kari refers to, incidentally, has been discredited and condemned by the entire professional medical community, denounced as being actively harmful to healthy development of individuals. Organisations that have gone on record to oppose the ineffective practise include [The American Psychological Association](http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/appropriate.html "But what do they know about psychological conditions?"), [The American Academy of Pediatrics](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;113/6/1827 "But what do they know about youth issues?"), [The American Medical Association](http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.shtml "But what do they know about health and well-being?"), [The American Counselling Association](http://www.clgs.org/official-statement-concerning-homosexuality-american-counseling-association "But what do they know about school counsellors?"), [The American Psychiatric Association](http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 "But what do they know about mental dysfunction?"), among several others.

When I first [wrote about Kari's complaint in March](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/03/anti-gay-human-rights-complaint-is-a-dud/ "Linky linky!"), I said that she likely knew all of this and intended to lose her own complaint, setting herself up for a ridiculous form of martyrdom to a tiny, but obsessive audience of anti-gay activists. Sure enough, she wasted no time playing the victim card, announcing that the decision has laid "the groundwork for a case of systemic discrimination," and that the Human Rights Commission "conveniently assisted" her to that effect.

Essentially, the complaint---in addition to wasting time and resources from people who have real human rights complaints to launch---was just a selfish attempt to leverage attention and spread the weak myth that gay people don't exist; that they're just dysfunctional straight people who need help escaping their sin.

It's the same, failed strategy with these anti-gay lobbyists. Kari feels no need to stop and reflect on why no student covered by her class-action complaint enthusiastically joined the endeavour, because she knows that no such student exists. It's all just pretend compassion, used for selfish, political ends.
