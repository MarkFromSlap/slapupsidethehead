The astute among you may have perceived _somewhat_ of a reduction in the frequency of updates over the past several weeks. With Slap approaching its seventh year, I need a break to focus on other things for a bit. In the meantime, by popular demand, a prancing unicorn has returned to the top of the page to keep all you amazing visitors company, and I remain as happy as ever to hear from you guys on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/slapupsidethehead "Poke my wall n stuff.") and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/MarkFromSlap "Twip my twerps 'n stuff.") during this Slap Upside the Hiatus.
