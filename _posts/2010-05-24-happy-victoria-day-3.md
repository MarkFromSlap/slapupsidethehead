Well, it's Victoria Day in Canada. For those unfamiliar with this grim holiday, tradition demands that one citizen be selected by lottery and sacrificed to appease the ghost of Queen Victoria. This goes back to the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century, where the vengeful Queen wished this curse on Canada as reparation for Princess Louise's terrifying sleigh accident in February of 1840. Of course, nowadays the sacrificial ceremony is all done in effigy as solemn historical remembrance. Queen Victoria, having calmed herself a bit in the afterlife, seems to be OK with it. Regular posts will resume on Wednesday. Have a great holiday, kids!
