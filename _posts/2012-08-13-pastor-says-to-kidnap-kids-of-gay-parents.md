![Brian Fischer gets abducted by aliens as part of the just Skyward Railroad.]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/08/brian-fischer-abduction.jpg' | relative_url}} "The only acceptable abduction I can think of")

Bryan Fischer, a U.S. pastor, has called for an organized plan to kidnap children from same-sex parents and deliver them to opposite-sex households as part of a modern-day "underground railroad."

When it was pointed out that this plan would be illegal, Fischer replied: "So was the underground railroad."

Hmm... I don't suppose there's an underground neural-road available to surgically liberate brains from those who clearly have no use of them and deliver them to starving zombies? Because I think an underused brain has just revealed itself.

Statistics, incidentally, have shown that children of same-sex parents actually tend to fair better than those of opposite-parents. This isn't because same-sex parents are inherently better at parenting than opposite-sex couples, of course. It's just that gay parents don't have unplanned children, eliminating a segment that skews toward troubled upbringings.
