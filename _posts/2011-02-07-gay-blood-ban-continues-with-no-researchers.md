![Nosferatu hesitates over a sleeping gay couple.]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/02/nosferatu.jpg' | relative_url}} "Nosferatu is homophobic.")

Canadian Blood Services continues to ban blood donations from gay males, permanently barring all men who have had sex with another man---even once---since 1977. It's a dumb policy, and one that helps propagate the myth that all gay men are sexually promiscuous and inherently dangerous to the blood supply.

That could change, though; many other countries implement a questionnaire that bases their bans on risky sexual practices, such as having multiple partners and unprotected sex, rather than simple sexual orientation. It makes a lot of sense, particularly since it would also catch tainted blood from heterosexuals---a group which currently has barely any restrictions in Canada. But so far CBS isn't budging, citing a need for research.

That research, incidentally, should be underway---but it's not. CBS set aside $500,000 in research grants two years ago to help fund studies into implementing a different policy, but not one scientist has applied for the funding yet.

So, what's the deal, medical researchers? I know it's competitive to find funding for scientific research, so it can't be that you guys don't want it. Surely this is just a matter of poor advertising for the grant.

Of course, if no one else wants the money, I have my M.Sc.

It's in a completely unrelated field of science, mind you, but I'm sure I could wing it. Any science not based in math is just improvisation anyway. So, yeah, call me?
