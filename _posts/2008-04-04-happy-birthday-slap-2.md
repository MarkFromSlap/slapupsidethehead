![Happy Birthday, Slap!]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/04/happy-birthday-slap.png' | relative_url}} "For the graph geek in all of us...")

Can you believe it? Tomorrow is **Slap Upside The Head**'s second anniversary!

Yes, it's been a full two years since I doled out my first virtual slap in a somewhat irrelevant story on [Brigitte Bardot](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/04/brigitte-bardot-pleads-to-canadians/ "It's about the seal hunt. I guess I could have picked something a tad more relevant for the first Slap story, no?").

To commemorate Slap's blogiversary, my boyfriend (fianc√© now, actually) gave me a night away from the computer by creating this birthday flowchart in Microsoft Word. I think it's every bit as adorable, funny, and clever as its artist.

Here's to many more years!
