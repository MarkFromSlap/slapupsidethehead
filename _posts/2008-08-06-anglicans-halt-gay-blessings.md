Worldwide Anglican bishops have ended their once-a-decade conference with a "wide agreement" on implementing a moratorium on gay blessings. In a statement, Anglican Leader Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said that non-acceptance of the moratorium would put the entire church in "grave peril."

(As an off-topic interjection, nominees for this year's **Enjoyable Hyperbole Awards** will be announced shortly. Stay tuned!)

The issue of same-sex blessings has deeply divided the Anglican community, which genuinely appears on the [brink of separation](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/06/conservative-anglicans-battle-progressive-churches/ "All in all a bizarre situation"). Progressive churches say that the bible has never condemned or forbid loving, monogamous, same-sex unions, and the overwhelming message of love instructs them to bless all parishioners without judgement. Conservative factions disagree, particularly within the international Anglican community.

The rift has been controversial, to understate the matter. Over 200 bishops have boycotted the conference, and one gay bishop was [barred from attending](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/07/worldwide-anglican-conference-bars-their-own-bishop/ "Becaues banning someone always prevents contention"). Both sides did appear to agree to lay off the rhetoric, though. In a joint statement, the bishops announced that "we need to repent of statements and actions that have further damaged the dignity of homosexual persons." The church then imploded from the contradiction.
