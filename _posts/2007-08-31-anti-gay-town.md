A human rights complaint has been filed against the town of Truro for refusing to fly a gay Pride flag, while accommodating other organisations' flag-flying requests.

Although the town's decision to pass on the Pride flag inherently raised suspicions of homophobia, Truro mayor Bill Mills removed all doubt when he delivered this gem to the media: "If I have a group of people that says pedophiles should have rights, do we raise their flag too?"

Now, I've written about why the mayor's understanding of the Pride flag is [deeply flawed](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/ "Pride is not about flaunting sexuality"), but I have to say I'm a little concerned that a human rights complaint---filed over what basically amounts to a rude dismissal---would turn him into a martyr of sorts. (I can see the "pro-family" headlines spinning now: "Glorious Mayor Mills Tortured and Fed to Eels By Homosexual Secularists For Bravely Defending Religious Freedoms.")

Truro Pride, the group that filed the complaint, said the town did not contact them to resolve the matter privately, and the complaint was necessary to kick-start discussion and draft an official policy for flag raising---a valid strategy when dealing with stubborn and wrong policy-makers. Let's just hope the concerns are resolved quickly and civilly.
