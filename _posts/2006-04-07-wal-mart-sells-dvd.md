![Brokeback Mountain at Wal-Mart]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/04/brokeback_walmart.jpg' | relative_url}})

_Won't someone **please** think of the children?_ Alberta-filmed [Brokeback Mountain](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/ "Brokeback on the IMDB") is available for purchase at [Wal-Marts](http://www.walmart.ca/ "Walmart Canada") across the country despite the wailing of an American Christian advocacy group. Imagine---Wal-Mart selling DVDs! Have they no shame?

In a statement issued on their website, Mississippi-based American Family Association urged parents to visit local Wal-Marts and protest their "decision to promote and carry [a] pro-homosexual movie." This, supposedly, instead of simply not purchasing the film, since I'm sure most Wal-Mart shoppers regularly knock unwanted products into their carts by accident.

Curiously, the no doubt _humongous_ stampede of horrified families evacuating Wal-Mart en masse didn't seem to hurt sales. 1.4 million Brokeback DVDs were sold in North America on the first day.
