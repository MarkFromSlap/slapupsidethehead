Slap reader Paul has written in with some good news coming out of Nova Scotia. The province passed its [Transgendered Persons Protection Act](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2012/11/20/ns-transgender-bill.html "Passed!") on Friday, explicitly protecting trans Nova Scotians from housing and employment discrimination. The bill still requires royal assent before becoming law, but there's nothing to worry about there. I've yet to see the terms "queen" and "denied GLBT rights" appear alongside each other.
