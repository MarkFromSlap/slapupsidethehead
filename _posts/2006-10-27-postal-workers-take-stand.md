Over 70 Vancouver postal workers walked off the job yesterday morning after discovering they were to deliver unaddressed homophobic pamphlets. The 28-page pamphlets, published by an Ontario church, tells gay readers that they are "ungodly, unhealthy, and unnatural" and calls AIDS "the consequences of homosexuality."

[Canada Post](http://www.canadapost.ca/ "You may have heard of them...") responded by saying they're not in the business of censorship and will deliver the pamphlets, but would also not require that their postal workers handle them. Instead, managers will put the offensive brochures into envelopes and deliver them themselves. (Though, I suspect the envelopes are just a matter of convenience, as duct-taping the pamphlets into balls, dipping them into vats of self-curing synthetic compounds, then soldering them shut in elegant steel sarcophagi locked by puzzles requires unaffordable resources.)

Of course, in fairness, I haven't seen the pamphlets so I can't verify whether or not they'd qualify as hate mail under Canadian law. It's my strong belief that---barring the incitement of hatred---every Canadian has the right to speak their mind. But, to the person that crafted the fliers... Dude, seriously, that can't be your excuse...

Sending lengthy, unsolicited homophobic pamphlets _half-way across the country_? Talk about misplaced zeal! Just because you have the right to do something doesn't make it the right thing to do, bucko!
