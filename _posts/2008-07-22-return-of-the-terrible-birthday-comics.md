Hey kiddos! I'm taking a short vacation this week to celebrate my birthday. Fret not, though! To make up for my absence, there will be a brand-new, exceptionally low-quality comic strip every day this week! It's the [return](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/07/terrible-birthday-comics/ "Actually, I think this year's are worse...") of the **Terrible Birthday Comics**!

**Monday Edition**  
 ![]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/07/tbc-star-gazing.png' | relative_url}} "Ah, optimism.")

**Tuesday Edition**  
 ![]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/07/tbc-social-mistake.png' | relative_url}} "What? Why are you looking at me like that?")

**L'Ã©dition du mercredi**  
 ![]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/07/tbc-computer-help.png' | relative_url}} "MS Word has this feature.")

**Thursday Edition**  
 ![]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/07/tbc-birthday-surprise.png' | relative_url}} "Not that this comes from personal experience or anything. (Weeps softly)")

**Friday Edition**  
 ![]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/07/tbc-ex-gay.png' | relative_url}} "Don't try this at home, kids.")
