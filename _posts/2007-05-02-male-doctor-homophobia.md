Researchers at the University of Alberta's Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic have found that athletes prefer female doctors to male ones. While the results were primarily attributed to the non-confrontational and caring attitude of female doctors, Dr. Marni Wesner, one of the researchers conducting the work, said she was taken off-guard by one additional recurring element: homophobia.

In particular, Wesner said that some male athletes expressed they'd dislike a male team doctor because they "don't know if he's gay."

Now, this might just be me, but a doctor's sexual orientation would _probably_ concern me less than, say, the _crippling pain_ that sent me there in the first place. Though, if potential attraction were a concern, I'd remind myself that doctors have seen so much anatomy under the context of injuries and infections that they probably turned asexual long ago.
