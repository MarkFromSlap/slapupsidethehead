![That should lower the divorce rate.](/wp-content/media/2009/09/extreme-divorce.jpg "That should lower the divorce rate.")

Canada's pretty cool. No matter who you are or where you're from, you can make your marriage commitments official up here---including gay couples from countries where same-sex marriages are not recognized. Just, maybe, don't expect to get divorced if things don't work out.

Divorces in Canada are, in fact, a legal impossibility unless at least one half of the couple has lived here for over a year. This is presumably because, unlike marriages, divorces are costly legal ordeals involving joint property transfer that need to be dealt with in local jurisdictions. That's a problem for same-sex couples who can't get divorced in their local jurisdiction because their marriage isn't recognized there in the first place.

It's quite a pickle, really. Luckily there's an elegant solution: Legalize equal marriage rights everywhere!
