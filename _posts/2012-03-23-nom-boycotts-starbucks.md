Nation for Marriage, one of the United States' largest anti-gay lobby groups, is [launching a boycott](http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/03/starbucks-ceo-dismisses-nom.html) against Starbucks over the company's support for equal marriage rights. Gosh, I wonder how Starbucks will weather the loss of their closed-minded, religious fanatic customer segment. I'll be sure to report on the monetary damage as more news comes in, although for brevity, I'll henceforth refer to the lost customer segment by their names: Buck and Peggy.
