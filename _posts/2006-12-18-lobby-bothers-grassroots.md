Ah, the poor anti-gay lobby. They seem so lost now---like a big-eyed, cuddly... manta-ray. But, hey, after investing so much time and money into a destined-to-fail cause, they've got to do something to keep up their spirits. And that's why they've started their very own grassroots movement! (Or, at the very least, some sort of astroturf underpadding movement.)

Despite polls consistently suggesting otherwise, MP-turned-lobbyist Pat O'brien insists that Canadians don't consider the same-sex marriage issue dead. Pat's group, Defend Marriage Canada, says they've mobilized grassroots groups all over the country. According to Pat, the only way the issue will truly die is if "you buy into the spin that it's over."

So there you go: The announcement that Harper kept his promise and officially considers the issue dealt with is _really_ just "spin" to cover the reality that he _doesn't_ consider the issue dealt with at all. Fascinating! Kudos you to, clever media. Kudos!
