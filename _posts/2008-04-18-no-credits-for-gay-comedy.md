![Determining Film Taxes]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/04/determining-taxes.jpg' | relative_url}} "Holy Mother Of Sweet Interjections!")

[Breakfast With Scot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910847/ "Sewiously, it's adowable..."), an unbelievably sweet comedy about a closeted gay couple who unexpectedly finds themselves raising a bubbly 11-year old boy, is under attack once again by anti-gay lobbyists.

Previously, the Canadian Family Action Coalition led [a boycott of the NHL](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/nhl-harassed-boycotted/ "Maybe internal polling suggested that Canadians supported a hockey boycott...") over the film, which licensed the Toronto Maple Leafs logo. The boycott wasn't very successful. (_Go Habs!_)

This time, though, Charles McVety, a spokesperson for the group, is seeking government intervention. He singled out the family comedy as being one that would have all its tax credits revoked by the government if Bill C-10, which is currently in front of the senate, were to pass into law. The bill seeks to deny tax credits to films after they've been produced if the content is found to be "objectionable."

McVety---who previously [claimed responsibility](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/03/film-censorship-bill/ "Maybe he just forgot if he's responsible...") for Bill C-10, but has since backpeddled---summarized Breakfast With Scot as a film about "an 11-year-old boy who is being raised by a homosexual Toronto Maple Leaf to be a homosexual."

Ignoring, for a moment, that the notion that someone can be raised to be homosexual is rejected completely by the psychological, medical, and academic community, I'm amazed by this misclassification. Either McVety has never seen the film, or he is lying about what he saw.

I had the privilege to see Breakfast with Scot last autumn in attendance with the director, producers, and its young star. It was a sweet, family comedy about a closeted hockey star and his lawyer husband who like to keep their lives discreet. They suddenly find themselves caring for a tragically orphaned 11-year-old, who enjoys cooking, dressing up in feather boas, singing Christmas carols in summer, and drawing exactly the sort of attention that his new guardians like to avoid. I won't ruin the story, but to describe the film as anything but a gentle holiday comedy with strong, moral themes is dishonest.

Still, McVety has targeted and seeks to punish this film because the guardian characters are gay---a point central to the film's comedic premise. "We are objecting to films that proselytize young people into homosexuality," he told reporters. Laurie Lynd, the filmmaker, was stunned, adding that if the movie's tax credits were revoked, it "could have killed the film completely."

McVety has said multiple times that Bill C-10 is about ending the funding of pornography with tax dollars. That's not what he's demonstrating, especially since policies are already in place to prevent that. Instead, this bill is about revoking tax credits (_not_ even funding) from any films that disagree with McVety's ideology---and after they've been made, to boot. With this broad definition of what constitutes an objectionable film, and with an after-the-fact process, Bill C-10 will force filmmakers to reconsider producing anything with content as edgy as, well, a gay couple.

Sigh. Maybe I'll just produce **_Slap Upside The Head: The Animated Film_ stateside.**
