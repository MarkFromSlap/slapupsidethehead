[Camp Fyrefly](http://www.usask.ca/education/fyrefly/)---a Canadian summer camp for GLBT youth---has [announced that it is expanding](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/story/2012/04/19/sk-camp-fyrefly-120419.html) this summer, admitting 50% more campers than last year. That's pretty impressive. In fact, at this rate, the camp will exceed the population of Canada in just 33 years---and the population of Earth just 13 years later. World domination is ours!
