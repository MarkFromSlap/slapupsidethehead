The Utah state senate has voted in favour of a bill [forbidding discussion of homosexuality](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/08/utah-senate-votes-to-stop-discussion-of-homosexuality-in-schools/) in classrooms, even if a question was posed by a student. Other jurisdictions are now reportedly considering legislation forbidding discussion of Utah.
