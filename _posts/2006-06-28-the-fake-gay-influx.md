Canadian Embassies are on the look-out for straight guys in sheep's fabulous, designer clothing, as young men in India have been **pretending to be gay** in order to immigrate to Canada. The crazy scheme uses India's discriminatory ban on homosexuality as a basis for visa applications. Since Canada is one of the few countries that treats same-sex couples equally for immigration purposes, it's an easy target.

While this _pink-is-the-new-scheme_ appears to be relatively harmless at first glance, some of India's gay activists are worried. "This may force the embassy to put a blanket ban on immigration on such grounds, which will affect genuine persons," said one Indian gay rights lawyer, adding that "international sympathy for the same-sex marriage movement may get diluted."

So, basically, Indian guys: If you're actually gay, be sure to turn up that "flame" of yours; the Canadian embassy is starting to get suspicious of your hetero counterparts, and you don't want to be mistaken for straight now, do you?
