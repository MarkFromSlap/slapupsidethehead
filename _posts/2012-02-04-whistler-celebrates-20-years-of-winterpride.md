Gay skiers have something to look forward to this week. Whistler is celebrating [20 years of WinterPRIDE](http://www.whistlerquestion.com/article/20120119/WHISTLER01/301199959/-1/whistler/winterpride-celebrates-20-years-with-milestones "I could make a gay people with poles joke here..."), its annual weeklong GLBT ski event. They started this in 1992, if you can believe it---although it _may_ have been an effort by anti-gay groups to get gay people involved in horrible ski accidents. Luckily it turned out to be a lot more fun. Congrats to Whistler on the milestone! <small>(Hat tip to Melanie for the story.)</small>
