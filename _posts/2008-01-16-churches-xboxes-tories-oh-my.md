![Pile O' Slaps: Volume I](/wp-content/media/2008/01/pile-o-slaps-v1.jpg)

In my web travels, I often come across stories that I _intend_ to share, but then become distracted by newer, shinier stories---or feel too lazy to illustrate them in any meaningful or interesting way. Well, no more! Today, I present to you the first-ever **Pile o' Slaps**! (i.e., really old stories that I'd otherwise just delete out of my queue.)

Canadian Anglicans [have appealed](http://www.anglicanjournal.com/issues/2008/134/jan/article/canada-calls-on-canterbury-to-intervene/ "I guess he's like the Pope of Anglicanism?") to the Archbishop of Canterbury to sternly lecture the [runaway parishes](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/12/more-anglicans-leave/ "Yes, temper tantrums are possible in adults.") that evacuated the country over same-sex blessings. It seems that some of these parishes are continuing to minister in Canada remotely from [somewhat more exotic locations](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/11/bishop-leaves-canada/ "a.k.a. Somewhere I've never heard of before now.") without all those pesky equal marriage rights.

Students across the country continue to protest Canadian Blood Services' ban on gay blood donors. Wait... Haven't I [written](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/01/why-cant-gay-men-donate/ "Give the gift of life...") [something](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/11/tidbits-from-the-road/ "Unless you're gay") [about](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/05/us-upholds-donor-ban/ "Because gays don't have blood in the veins") [this](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/03/gay-blood-donors/ "Just gay juice") before?

U.S. Soldiers, presumably fatigued by the war in Iraq, are [asking and telling](http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2007/11/16/4661806-ap.html "So much for my military gaydar proposal...") a lot more these days, as army deserters are at their highest level since 1980. Unlike Canada and---well, pretty much every other well-off nation with a military---gays in the U.S. are [forbidden to serve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_ask,_don't_tell "What about guessing?") in the army openly. What's that slogan, again? Repress All That You Can Be?

The federal Tories have [refused to investigate](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/05/30/rcmp-inquiry-070530.html "It's called 'Accountability'") homophobic abuse within the RCMP, despite calls from the opposition to do so. That's pretty much in line with their stance of a tougher police force, mind you.

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has hinted that his [next film](http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=645ea831-d37c-41f5-ada5-301a47101e8b&k=9796 "No, he hasn't stopped") may be about gay rights in the states. The film will purportedly outline all of the civil rights that gays have won in the U.S. since the Stonewall days, giving it a runtime of about one-and-a-half minutes.

Singapore has banned Mass Effect, an XBox 360 game, over [lesbian intimacy](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071116.wgtgameban1116/BNStory/Technology "Being gay is especially not OK for aliens, I guess") between two aliens. Due to the ban, 14-year-old Singaporean boys will now have to use a [different Microsoft product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer "With parental controls disabled, no doubt") to access their intimacy depictions.

OK, enough of that. Until Friday, kiddos!
