An appeals court in Texas has ruled that a gay couple who married out of state can not get divorced.

The couple, who married each other four years ago while living in Massachusetts, are now forced to remain legally married unless they move back to Massachusetts and get a divorce there. While a lower court initially granted the divorce, it was appealed by the state's Attorney General on the claim that granting a divorce would lead to same-sex marriage.

So, there you go; forcing a gay couple to stay married is now a state strategy in keeping same-sex marriage illegal. It's _almost_ logical, I suppose... like stopping a kid from smoking by forcing him to finish an entire pack of cigarettes. Or something.

Texas, of course, doesn't recognize equal marriage rights. What the state was really afraid of is that granting a divorce would essentially amount to having recognized the marriage. It's a bit of absurd paranoia, if you ask me. Particularly since equal marriage rights is an inevitability as more and more people shed their fears and prejudices about gay people. In the meantime, enjoy your forced marriage, anonymous couple. Texas is seeing to it!
