If anyone's missing their sheepskin rug in London, Ontario, I think we have a new lead! Dave Burghardt, a Liberal campaign volunteer, was dismissed from his post yesterday after news broke about his, uh, _interesting_ blog. Dave was originally hired as the communication's director for Liberal MP candidate Glen Pearson.

Now, Dave's blog seems to have mysteriously vanished from the Inter-web, but luckily [Google's cache](http://72.14.209.104/search?hl=en&q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftherightofleft.blogspot.com%2F2005_02_01_therightofleft_archive.html&btnG=Google+Search&meta= "Full of cachey, anti-gay goodness!") is capable of seeing through time. That means the blog's not really gone; and, let me tell you, it' something to behold! Here are just a few gems: (Say, why don't you grab some popcorn? I'll wait.)

- On Belinda Stronach leaving the Tories: "all of this demonstrates one more reason why women shouldn't be allowed to run for office, much less vote."
- After same-sex marriage becoming law: "the oligarchy of the Supreme Court will strike [religious freedom] down and classify your Bible as Hate Literature round about Thanksgiving Day 2006. Heard it here first!"
- His description of same-sex marriage itself: "the God given right to making a life long commitment to anal sex."
- He gives a hearty "Bravo" to the following comment on the gays: "try interfering with [their] bathhouse sex habits, then listen to the sonic cries of 'homophobia' reverberate across the land."
- And a few posts down: **"apparently some people think I am obsessing about same-sex marriage..."**

Obsessing? _No, no, no_! Well... Maybe, OK---yeah: Obsessing. Why, there's even a full-out essay on the evils of gays, which includes this insightful paragraph:

> When some scientific evidence suggests a genetic predisposition for homosexual orientation, the case is not significantly different from evidence of predispositions toward other traits---for example, alcoholism or violence.

Fascinating comparison; he's a pip, that one! Well, good luck with your new party affiliation, sir! (_Awooooo!_)
