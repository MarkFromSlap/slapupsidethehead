Have you ever wanted to insert a generic and practically microscopic representation of a gay couple into your text messages only to discover that all available visual iconography was _exclusively heterosexual_? Well, I say straight people have had this unshared privilege for too long! It's time for a violent revolt! Take up your medieval weaponry and... Oh. It looks like [Apple added same-sex icons in an iOS update](http://m.gizmodo.com/5918381/apple-adds-gay-and-lesbian-couple-icons-to-ios-6).

ðŸ‘¬ Mission accomplished! ðŸ‘­
