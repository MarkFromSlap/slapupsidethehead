Calgary's mayor, Dave Bronconnier, announced at a mayoral debate on Wednesday that he could not "condone" the gay "lifestyle," adding that if he had any choice in the matter, he would not have allowed Tourism Calgary to promote the city to gays. The mayor's remarks were in response to an audience member's complaint that her tax dollars were spent on a [tourism campaign](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/01/calgary-gay-friendly/ "And I took it real seriously...") directed at gays and lesbians. (The poor dear!)

The woman, who angrily waved the tourism ad in her hand while asking the question, is one of Calgary's many crazies who just _have_ to declare how much they dislike gays at every available public venue, adding to the city's unique image and charm. While the mayor said that the tourism agency's marketing campaigns is not under his jurisdiction, he also felt compelled to sympathize with the question-asker instead of leaving the whole thing out of his hands.

Of course, when pressed by reporters to clarify his remarks, Bronco said it was the lady's question that he wouldn't condone. He did not clarify why he wouldn't have allowed the Tourism Calgary campaign, or what his "lifestyle" comment was referring to.

As a former Calgary resident, I'm just happy to no longer be living somewhere where people go out of their way to distance themselves from my "lifestyle" (which I just call my "life;" it's not terrifically different from anyone else's).
