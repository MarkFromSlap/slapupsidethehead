![An old timey doctor attempts to cure a homosexual with an unusually large leech.]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/02/bad-doctor.jpg' | relative_url}} "Nurse, I need two spoonfuls of castor oil and a rectal thermometer, STAT!")

Last year, Alberta [_finally_ removed homosexuality from its list of disorders](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/01/alberta-delists-homosexuality-as-mental-disorder/ "It's understandable; messages are still delivered by horseback there.") that doctors in the province could bill the government for treating. This was 38 years after the disorder was delisted by the American Psychological Association, of course, but Alberta's a little slow and deserved some congratulations for taking the leap forward into about _four decades ago_.

Strangely, it seems that not all doctors have got the memo about the change. Kathleen Range, a spokesperson for Alberta Health and Wellness confirmed to the media on Friday that Albertan doctors are continuing to submit diagnostic codes for treatment of homosexuality along with their billing information.

Sounds like some of these doctors might be suffering from a case of old timey Albertanism. Some ground eggshells, castor oil, a good dose of electroshock and---if all else fails---relocation therapy ought to do the trick, don't you think?
