Here's another win for science! A controversial study conducted in 2001 that claimed a small minority of gay people were able to change their sexual orientation from gay to straight [has been retracted by its author](http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/660604), admitting that the study simply did not survive the peer review process and that its conclusions were unsupported. In fact, no study suggesting that sexual orientation is changeable has ever been successfully reproduced or has survived the rigors of scientific scrutiny. Of course, I'm sure that "ex-gay" organizations, [like Exodus](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/action/), will be updating their promotional material to reflect this retraction immediately.
