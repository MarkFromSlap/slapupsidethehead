![Not an Inn per se, but their continental breakfast is phenominal]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/06/stonewall.jpg' | relative_url}} "Not an Inn per se, but their continental breakfast is phenominal")

Yesterday was the 40<sup><small>th</small></sup> anniversary of the famous [Stonewall riots](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/03/dr-flamingo-jones-and-the-great-hairpin-drop/ "Dr. Jones explains it better than I could."), the movement widely recognised as sparking the worldwide gay rights movement.

Forty years ago, it seemed far fetched that gay people could live openly without fear of being arrested; now, as more and more people are less afraid to live their lives freely, worldwide attitudes and long-held misconceptions have changed.

Here in Canada, gay people are _almost_ treated completely equally under the law, and other countries are moving in the same direction. Right now, [India is reviewing laws](http://www.tolerance.ca/Article.aspx?ID=48899&L=en "Has their been a Bollywood Brokeback musical yet?") that criminalize homosexuality. Ireland is [considering adding equal partnership rights](http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/3/article_7623.php "The country will still be a lovely shade of green, but no longer just with envy!") in the form of civil union. Gay rights marches are happening all over the world everywhere from [Jerusalem, Israel](http://blogs.reuters.com/axismundi/2009/06/25/the-many-sides-of-jerusalems-gay-pride-parade/ "A big deal, actually!") to [Ljubljana, Slovenia](http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&id=1404664 "I don't know much about the place, but I applaud them!") to [Istanbul, Turkey](http://globespotters.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/istanbuls-gay-pride-week-roundup/ "The gays there aren't chicken, for sure!") to [Sofia, Bulgaria](http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=105096 "Sofia... I just met a city named Sofia...").

There's still work to do both at home and abroad, but as gay people become more and more visible, people challange their own prejudices. What a great time to be part of it!
