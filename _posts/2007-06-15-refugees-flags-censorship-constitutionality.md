![Mini Slaps](/wp-content/media/2007/06/mini-slaps.jpg)  
Let's do the follow-up thing today:

- Alvaro Orozco, the refugee who was denied Canadian citizenship because [he didn't look "gay enough"](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/not-gay-enough/ "He didn't even lisp!") is [still facing deportation](http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=1&STORY_ID=3118&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 "He should have 'gayed it up,' I guess...") to Nicaragua where homosexuality is illegal. The application to re-open his case was dismissed, but there's still a chance he could file a standard application for immigration from within Canada on humanitarian grounds. Sadly, [pretending to be gay to obtain refugee status](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/06/the-fake-gay-influx/ "People are always too willing to take advantage of a good thing") is not uncommon, but the circumstances under which Orozco's application was denied were downright silly.
- Niagara Falls officials have [replaced the Pride flag](http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/webapp/sitepages/content.asp?contentid=563779&catname=Local%20News&classif= "In all its rainbow-ey-ness") that [mysteriously vanished](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/06/pride-flag-disappears/ "Would an anti-gay vandal really have risked being seen with one?") less than four hours after its raising ceremony. Thankfully they have "some ideas" to make sure this one stays put. At the top of the list: piping in Kylie Minogue to create an appropriate anti-heterosexual radius.
- The City of Ottawa has adopted policies ensuring that Capital Xtra, a gay community newspaper, [cannot be censored](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2007/04/25/xtra-070425.html "I'd have a hayday if I could get any magazine that offended me removed from public") from city community centres. The paper was removed from a public facility after Greg Evans, a local man, [complained](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/03/ottawa-pulls-newspaper/ "Because information about the latest Rufus Wainwright CD would be just too much.") that his son could have seen it at basketball practice. Though the paper's censorship was illegal, I can attest to the dangers of gay community newspapers: The last time I picked one up, I got a paper cut.
- The federal conservatives' [scrapping](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/tories-cut-equality-funding/ "One of their worst, purely ideological, offenses.") of the gay-friendly Court Challenges Program has [turned out to be illegal](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/05/11/court-languages.html "The program was there for a reason, after all"). According to a report by the official languages commissioner, removing public funding to challenge unconstitutional laws violated Officials Languages Act. The government, in the interests of transparency and accountability, has not responded.

Well, have a great weekend kiddos!
