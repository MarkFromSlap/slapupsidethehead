Well, today is the last day to file your 2005 taxes in Canada. **But** , for the first time in history, the astonishingly dull _Income Tax Act_ has been amended to recognize married same-sex couples! Additionally, all references to "natural parent" have been removed, so adoptive couples' children will be recognized equally, too.

This is fantastic news for anyone who isn't completely delusional, which obviously doesn't include the numerous anti-gay groups that tried to prevent this from happening. So to the anti-gay fossils, I say " **_Slap!_**" And to all supporters, I say "Thanks for making the mundanity of spousal tax filing accessible to all!"
