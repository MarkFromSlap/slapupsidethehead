Well, I'm officially gay married! (Please accept my apologies for any earthquakes or natural disasters that may have occurred on Sunday as a result of my wedding.)

Thanks to everyone who sent me their best wishes! Things went really, amazingly well. I'm now taking a short break to relax, so there won't be any site updates until Monday. In the meantime, please feel free to visit and interact on Slap's exciting [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/slapupsidethehead "Not quite a face... Not quite a book...") and [Twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/MarkFromSlap "Twirpirpeetwarp!"). For today's topic of interaction, please select one of: a) The effects of postmodernist expression on contemporary authorship; or, b) Gay stuff.
