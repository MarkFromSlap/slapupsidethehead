![Hint: It's the difference with the big red circle around it]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/07/spot-the-difference.jpg' | relative_url}} "Hint: It's the difference with the big red circle around it")

Police in Fort Worth, Texas have violently raided a newly-opened gay bar on the 40<sup><small>th</small></sup> anniversary of the Stonewall riots, arresting seven people for "public intoxication" (inside a bar?) and sending one to intensive care with brain injuries.

Contrary to eyewitness accounts---which describes terrified bar patrons trying to stay out of the officers' way---a police press release claimed that extra force was required after several patrons made physical sexual advances on the officers.

You know, because, apparently, when multiple angry policemen barge into your local bar and start arresting people, us gays just can't resist groping them.

Or, as the bar owner put it:

> The groping of the police officer---really? We're gay, but we're not dumb!
