![Cyberbullying](/wp-content/media/2010/03/cyber-bully.jpg "BuLly1N9 i5 A S1gniPHi1(nT pR0BL3/\/\ pH0R 7oDAyZ j007H.")

A new study out of Iowa State University suggests that gay and lesbian teenagers are among the hardest hit by cyberbullying, a phenomenon unique to today's youth. With the popularity of social networking, bullies have found new venues to harass and ostracize their peers, often without the threat of adult intervention.

The numbers aren't terrifically encouraging. 54% of gay youth and friends of gay youth reported being cyberbullied within the thirty days prior to the researchers' survey. The next highest group was females, at 21%.

Less encouraging still, victims of cyberbullying reported feeling helpless, with 55% saying that their parents couldn't do anything to stop it, and 57% saying they don't believe school officials could help either.

To help ameliorate the situation, I've decided to make an actual cybernetic bully, programmed to protect gay youth against its human counterparts. Any investors?
