Aw, isn't that just adorable? After losing the premiership race for Alberta in a distant third place, Ted Morton has been given a nice sympathy position as the Minister of Sustainable Resource Development by incoming premier Ed Stelmach.

Now, what do you suppose was one of Morton's first announcements to the press? Something to do with sustainable resource development, you think? Why, _no_, silly! Instead, Teddy re-emphasized his commitment to introduce anti-gay legislation.

That's right, Ted Morton is determined to bring back one of the most discriminatory pieces of legislation in Canadian history. Morton's Bill 208, which was already killed in parliament, resurrected, and killed again, would remove all legal punishment for those who discriminate against gays _and_ force teachers to "warn" parents before acknowledging the existence of same-sex marriage in Canada.

Now, if only I could deny the reality that Ted Morton is in cabinet, I'd be all set.

Incidentally, Alberta's new premier, Ed Stelmach, while personally against equal marriage rights, says he accepts the federal marriage law.
