It's official. Craig Chandler, Tory nominee for Calgary-Egmont, has had his candidacy rejected by Premer Ed Stelmach over [anti-gay human rights violations](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/11/premier-reviews-candidate/ "The violations were confirmed on Friday").

Undeterred, Chandler vows to run as an independent.

And with that, an Alberta tory has been ousted over anti-gay views. _Do do do do do do do do..._

(That was supposed to be the theme to the Twilight Zone.)
