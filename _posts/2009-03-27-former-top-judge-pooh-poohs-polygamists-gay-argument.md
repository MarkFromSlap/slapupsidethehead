Claire L'Heureux-Dube, a former Supreme Court judge, has predicted that the courts will toss out any arguments linking same-sex marriage to a polygamist sect in Canada.

Two men currently facing charges related to a religious cult in Bountiful, British Columbia [have already indicated](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/01/polygamous-sect-uses-gay-marriage-in-defense/ "Us gays have better have a good justification for this crazy, ultra-conservative religious cult!") that they will invoke gay marriage as an argument defending their dozens of wives.

"It is contrary to the equality of the sexes," L'Heureux-Dube said to the press, noting that in the United States these men would be charged with sexual exploitation rather than simply having multiple spouses. Indeed, the polygamy charges in Bountiful appear to be a blanket charge for greater accusations of incest and exploitation.

So where do the gays come in all of this? Beats me! I've only heard the argument from those wacky anti-gay lobbyists, not the actual connection.
