Three independent studies were released this month comparing gay couples to straight ones, and all have reached the same conclusion: They're every bit as successful.

The results of two studies were released in this month's issue of Developmental Psychology, while the third was released by The Rockway Institude, an affiliate of the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University.

In all three studies, the findings suggest the exact opposite of what anti-gay groups regularly announce: That gay couples lead less fulfilling lives. Glenn I. Roisman, the lead author of one of the studies, dismissed such claims completely:

> The belief that committed same-sex relationships are atypical, psychologically immature, or malevolent contexts of development was not supported by our findings. Compared with married [heterosexuals], committed gay males and lesbians were not less satisfied with their relationships.

One of the studies also revealed that married gay couples fare better than their non-married counterparts, suggesting that the protections offered by same-sex marriage strengthens bonds noticeably.

Hey, wait... Wasn't same-sex marriage supposed to destroy families or something?
