Perhaps discouraged by polls showing that opposition to equal rights for the GBLT community is falling rapidly, members of the Apostolic Truth Tabernacle Church in Greensburg, Indiana, have resorted to this: Coaching four year olds to sing "[Ain't no homos gonna make it to heaven](http://youtu.be/iRNbC-aSFLc)" to an applauding congregation. (And for those of you who need to clear your brain of the _mind-bogglingly hateful idiocy_ demonstrated in that video, I offer [this calming link](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=fluffy+orange+kittens) as therapeutic support.)
