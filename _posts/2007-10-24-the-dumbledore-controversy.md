![Point-Counterpoint: The Dumbledore Gay Controversy]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/10/point-counterpoint.jpg' | relative_url}})

Professor Albus Dumbledore, a character from a mildly popular book series that I can't quite remember the title of, [is gay](http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2007/10/20/dumbledore-gay.html "Headmaster... Tee hee."). Some people are furious, with a [Toronto Daily News columnist](http://www.torontodailynews.com/index.php/EntertainmentNews/2007102306Dumbledore-Gay "Mind you, I've never actually heard of this paper until now.") writing: "Such an ousting of one of the most beloved characters in [the] book had no value and may hurt the future of Harry Potter."

Here to discuss the controversy is [Laura Mallory](http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Story?id=3755544&page=2 "Yes, she's real.")---a Christian activist and anti-Harry Potter crusader---and Professor Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry:

**Laura Mallory, Point:**"My prayer is that parents would wake up; the subtle way this is presented as harmless fantasy would be exposed for what it really is---a subtle indoctrination into anti-Christian values. A homosexual lifestyle is a harmful one. That's proven, medically."

**Dumbledore, Counterpoint:**"I'm fictional."

Interesting discussion! Join us Friday for another engaging issue.
