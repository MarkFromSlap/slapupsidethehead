![She moves away from the mic to breathe in.](/wp-content/media/2009/05/school-report.jpg "She moves away from the mic to breathe in.")

Natalie Jones, a sixth grade student in San Diego, has been disallowed from reading her history report on Harvey Milk, the United State's first openly gay and tragically slain politician, until her fellow classmates receive permission from their parents to hear it.

Theresa Grace, the principal of the girl's elementary school, said that a school board policy forbids the teaching of any topics that include discussions of sexual orientation without first receiving parental permission.

Sound both absurd and familiar? It should! Ted Morton, a Conservative MLA in Alberta, has thrice tried to [introduce a bill](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/anti-gay-bill-targets-teachers/ "One of my earliest and most terrible illustrations!") that would implement the same policy province-wide. And now Lindsay Blackett, a Conservative cabinet minister, has introduced a similar bill that would [require teachers to pull students out of class](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/05/teachers-forced-to-warn-parents-of-gay-material/ "Danger, children! Danger!") unless they have permission to hear reports like Natalie's.

I guess I can see where they're coming from, though. I was involuntarily and irreversibly transformed into a homosexual after hearing too much of a classmate's report on the [Enola Gay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Gay "School reports are just that influential!").
