The subject of Canada's new trans-unfriendly airport screening regulations was brought up in the House of Commons during question period this week. Check out these [videos of Randall Garrison and Dany Morin](http://youtu.be/N7-EboYiLL4 "NDP members speak out against trans-unfriendly transport regulations") speaking in support of trans Canadians amidst jeers from the Conservative party, as well as a clip from [Liberal MP Justin Trudeau](http://youtu.be/zIX_bFnmyKM "OK, it's just an interpreter..."), who demonstrates his commitment by using a _phenomenal_ female voice.
