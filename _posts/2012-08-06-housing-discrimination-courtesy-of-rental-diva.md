![A diva-wannabe boldly announces](/wp-content/media/2012/08/rental-diva.jpg "Such as... What's her face. And that other lady!")

Rental Diva, an unlicensed rental agency in Brampton Ontario, is likely to face a human rights tribunal after turning away clients because they're gay.

Thiago Derucio and Christ Prentice called Juliet Stewart---operator of Rental Diva---about a basement suite, but were promptly told they could not rent the property because the landlord had indicated that they did not wish to accommodate gays. (What, she has a database field for that sort of thing?)

This seems pretty open-and-shut to me. Not only is Rental Diva violating Ontario's human rights code (with a rather lengthy chain of precedent against her favour), but she's operating without a license. That's pretty serious, and I can't imagine this business will be around much longer.

Still, there are unanswered questions. For example, how is it possible that an agency called "Rental Diva" isn't set up _specifically_ to cater to gay apartment hunters? That would be like me setting up a business called "Christian Biblical Lodgings for Jesus" and then refusing to accommodate anyone wearing a crucifix.

I swear, these cases are getting weirder and weirder by the day.
