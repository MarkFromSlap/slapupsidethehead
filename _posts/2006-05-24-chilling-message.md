Run for cover! Pope Benedict XVI has a **terrifying** message for us Canadians!

In an allusion to same-sex marriage, the pope has blamed Canada's **declining birth rate** on the "pervasive effects of secularism," reiterating that the church proclaims and supports legislation "to create and live in a family, without it being substituted or confused by other forms or different institutions."

Upon hearing this terrible news, I have no doubt that Canadians will be running out into the streets---copulating furiously to prevent extinction of the Canadian race. It will then be necessary to completely obliterate gay marriage, since **half** of all Canadians (or something) _turned gay_ when it was legalized!

Now, bring on the theocracy! _It's our only hope_!
