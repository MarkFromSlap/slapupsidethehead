![Military report: How to Treat Gay Colleagues in the Marines. Page Two: Just like everyone else.](/wp-content/media/2011/04/gay-military-report.png "Why the report needs to be any longer than this is a mystery to me.")

The United States Marine Corps has produced some new training material in anticipation of the official revocation of the country's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy later this year.

Parts of the documents are spot on. It's a good idea, for example, to prepare authority figures within the military on how to put an end to homophobic harassment and remind recruits that it's not appropriate to discriminate against or berate their colleagues.

Amusingly, though, the training documents also include expected responses to some hypothetical situations. This includes what should be done if you discover two men from your battalion kissing in a shopping mall, or if you see a fellow Marine marching in a Pride parade on TV.

While the document's suggested responses are exactly right, (i.e. act like it's none of your business), I find the situations amusingly alarmist---as if all gay Marines will instantly start making out and flying banners on television. Better prepare the troops so they know exactly what to do if---nay, _when_---it happens!

At least this is all a little less silly than all those surveys asking how military personnel would feel about showering alongside gay colleagues. Not by much, mind you.
