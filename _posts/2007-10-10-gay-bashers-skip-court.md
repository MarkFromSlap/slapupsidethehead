![Family Bonding](/wp-content/media/2007/10/family-bonding.jpg)

A father and son who beat a gay man in Lake Cowichan have skipped out on their court date last Tuesday, securing arrest warrants. Mark Edwards, a 21-year old gay man, said he was called slurs, punched, kicked, and choked by the pair because he was gay, and the attackers remain unrepentant. (I guess family bonding activities have changed since my childhood.)

Members of the gay community were appalled by the beating, and have organized a Safe Harbour Respect for All event which takes place on October 17<sup>th</sup>. The event, aimed at businesses and community members, will discuss anti-discrimination steps in an effort to build a more tolerant community.

First step: Encourage fishing instead of, say, pummeling.
