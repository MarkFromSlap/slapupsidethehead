![A man with green hair, being eaten by an alien, holds his grape-producing tree-like arm in the air so an ostrich with a vacuum cleaner can suck up the grapes.]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/09/makes-sense.jpg' | relative_url}} "Christmas Cheer")

The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), an anti-choice and anti-gay lobby group based in the UK, has distributed fliers suggesting that legal same-sex marriage will lead to an increased number of abortions.

"Legalised same-sex marriage will increase confusion about what it means to be a man or woman and removes natural conception from the idea of marriage," the pamphlet states. "We must protect real marriage because it protects children in the womb."

Now, I know it sounds like there are some logical connections missing in this assertion. You may think that, due to the dedication and procedures necessary for a gay or lesbian couple to have a child, abortions would be highly unlikely in the LGBT community. SPUC, however, was clearly limited for space and had to omit some details. So, on behalf of SPUC, here's how _I_ think that _they_ think this works:

All men are secretly gay and always have been, which is why governments enact laws to keep them from marrying each other. Once such legal barriers disappear, however, men will no longer be interested in any sort of physical reproduction with women, threatening the human race with extinction. Desperate for babies to continue our survival, humanity will have no choice but to construct a system of automated weaponry to launch razor-thin projectiles tipped with pre-fertilized eggs directly into the tummies of women (all of whom are still heterosexual since everyone knows that lesbianism is just a myth). The impregnated women---now alone and having left the kitchen to pursue careers---will be ill-equipped to raise their egg-gun children on their own, forcing them to choose between a quick abortion and a life of poverty. Piles of aborted fetuses will litter the cities, one beside each coin-operated abort-o-matic booth.

Did I get that right, SPUC?
