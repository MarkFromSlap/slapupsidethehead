![Slappy Holidays!]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/12/santa.jpg' | relative_url}})

Hey folks! Well, it's Christmas! And, though there's no news story today, I've prepared this delightfully lazy cartoon for you all. So, on behalf of this inanimate website, I wish you all the very merriest of Christmases and an exceptionally happy holiday.

May your season be extremely gay. As in "joyful." Unless you're like me, in which case I mean it the other way too.

Until the new year, folks!
