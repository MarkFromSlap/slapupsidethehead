![A despondent Stephen Harper thinks to himself:]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/02/despondent-harper.jpg' | relative_url}} "He always looks despondent, but this time he feels it.")

The federal Conservative Party introduced a bill on Friday that would explicitly confirm the validity same-sex marriages granted to foreigners in Canada, and extend the right to divorce to any foreign couple whose marriages are recognized in their country of origin.

This bill puts an end to a bizarre government court case where a federal lawyer [tried to argue](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2012/01/unspinning-the-same-sex-marriage-fiasco/ "Unspinning The Same-Sex Marriage Fiasco") that all Canadian same-sex marriages issued to foreigners are invalid, understandably causing a whole lotta drama last month.

It's pretty rare that the Tories do the right thing when it comes to GLBT issues, even for no-brainers like this, but this was definitely the correct action to take. So in what's probably the first such occurrence in the history of this site, I shall extend a _pat_ upside the head to the Tories for taking care of this swiftly and reasonably.

Of course, considering [Stephen Harper's backwards views on equal marriage rights](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5814478782999702361 "Let's let him explain this himself"), I imagine he must be curled up in a corner right now, hugging his knees, rocking himself softly to sleep. When you govern a country as progressive and diverse as Canada, sometimes you have to sacrifice your personal prejudices. (Sometimes, but clearly not always.)
