Let's forgo the mainstream news sources for today. It's time for some blog dredgin'!

Writing for his online column at the North Star Writers Group, [Gregory D. Lee](http://www.northstarwriters.com/gl060.htm "Never heard of him either."), an army recruitment officer, posts an article entitled "_Why Do Homosexuals Want to Serve in the Military? For Sex, Of Course_."

This should be a good one!

> [...] you need to understand that homosexuals predominantly want to serve in the military in order to have access to people their own age with whom to engage in sex. It's just that simple. It's all about sex, and not about serving the nation.

Totally. Why should all those randy, _randy_ gays bother with Internet hookups and the whole bar scene when they can ship off to Iraq and get some hot action in between the unspeakable horrors of war?

> It is not unheard of to have a lesbian officer coerce a lower enlisted woman into engaging in lesbian sexual activity. "I'm an officer and you're a private, who are they going to believe if you tell them I forced you to have sex with me?" Or two male soldiers go out on the town. One has too much to drink, and when they return to the barracks, he passes out in his buddy's room. When he wakes up, his "buddy" is performing fellatio on him. 

Gee, we gays are sex-obsessed. I never realised. Just for fun, though, let's try an exercise:

It is unheard of to have a straight, male officer coerce a lower enlisted woman in sexual activity. "I'm an officer and you're a private, who are they going to believe if you tell them I forced you to have sex with me?" Or a male and female soldier goes out on the town. One has too much to drink...

That was fun!

> Having openly gay men and women in close living quarters with heterosexuals would make straight soldiers uncomfortable, to say the least. The morale of units would decline almost immediately, and re-enlistments would most certainly suffer. 

Look, that's not fair; we gays have apologised several times for being ceaseless joy vaccuums, sucking the morale from all forms of life. It's awful, I admit, but we can't help it. Just the other day, I went to have a lovely brunch and three patrons collapsed of malaise; the rest swore never to visit a cafe again. It's unfortunate, but let's move on, OK?

> This is another example why liberals should never be in charge of national security.

Let's not tell Gregory who the new guy in charge is just yet, m'kay?

Have a great monday, soldiers!
