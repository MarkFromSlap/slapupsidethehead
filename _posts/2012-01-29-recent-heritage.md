Canada's famous (well, internally famous) Heritage Minutes got a new addition recently. The succinctly titled [Canada Gay Marriage](http://youtu.be/I2waZOYD0-A "If you live in Canada, you'll understand these things") may not be an [It's Time](http://youtu.be/_TBd-UCwVAY "This is how you do it, folks") in terms of quality, but hey, at least we're lucky enough to have it depict the past instead of the future!
