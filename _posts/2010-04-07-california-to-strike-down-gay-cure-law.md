![Gay researchers can finally stop.](/wp-content/media/2010/04/gay-research.jpg "60 years later...")

California is advancing a bill that will repeal a bizarre "gay cure" law from 1950. The law states that "the State Department of Mental Health shall plan, conduct and cause to be conducted scientific research into the causes and cures of sexual deviation, including [...] the causes and cures of homosexuality."

A bill to strike the ancient law advanced on a 4-0 vote, with three abstentions from members who supported the removal of the homosexuality reference, but would still like the law on the books to research sexual predators.

No word on whether or not the state will next stop its investigations of crop failures due to witchcraft.
