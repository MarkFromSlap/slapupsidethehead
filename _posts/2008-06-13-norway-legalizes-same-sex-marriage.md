![Norway Same-sex marriage]({{'/wp-content/media/2008/06/norway-marriage.jpg' | relative_url}} "They\'re in the club.")

Kathrine, an avid Slap reader and [Norwegian blogger](http://xrisimopoio.blogspot.com/ "Not Quite The Spectator Essays"), writes in with some fantastically amazing news from abroad!

Norway has officially legalized same-sex marriage by vote of 84 to 41. This makes Norway the sixth country in the world to permit equal marriage rights nationwide, alongside Belgium, Canada, Netherlands, South Africa, and Spain.

Congratulations, Norway, on this important victory!
