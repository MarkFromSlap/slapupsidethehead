The California Supreme Court reversed a state ban on same-sex marriages yesterday, allowing gay couples to legally wed in as little as 30 days. Chief Justice Ron George ushered in the ruling with a very nice annoucement:

> Our state now recognizes that an individual's capacity to establish a loving and long-term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individual's sexual orientation, and, more generally, that an individual's sexual orientation---like a person's race or gender---does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights.

Religious and social conservative groups are upset, as usual, and will challenge the ruling. They've also started the process of introducing a constitutional amendment to ban equal marriage rights, which would undercut the justice system.

Arnold Schwarzenegger has indic---you know, you think I'd be used to that by now, but, seriously, Arnold Schwarzenegger? Anyway, Arnold Schwarzenegger has indicated that he respects the Supreme Court's decision and will not support a marriage banning amendment.

Congratulations, California! It may not be over yet, but this is a phenomenal and important step.
