![A man rejects a gay job applicant:]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/06/weird-hiring-policy.jpg' | relative_url}} "This about sums it up for me.")

Crandall University, a school located in Moncton, New Brunswick, is under fire this month over its discriminatory hiring policies. The school, which is publicly funded, does not allow any gay staff members---and proudly announces so.

The "no gays" policy is almost certainly in violation of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, so Crandall University seems to be begging for a lawsuit or tribunal case. There's even Canadian legal precedent for exactly this situation from back in 1998, so I imagine the only reason the administrators aren't reversing the policy themselves is for the attention.

Incidentally, I refer to the school as _Crandall University_ only because that's what they call themselves. Neither the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, nor the Canadian Association of University Teachers recognize the institution as a university. I'm not even sure the school does itself, since they certainly don't seem to be interested in attracting the research talent for which real universities and colleges compete quite vigorously.

Well, either that, or they've discovered that gay people are lousy researchers...

Sincerely,  
Mark From Slap, M.Sc
