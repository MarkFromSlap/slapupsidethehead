A lot of gay people find their relationships don't receive much support from their parents, but I think a lot of us can be glad we don't have anyone quite this determined: A Hong Kong billionaire is offering over $65 million to any man who can [woo his daughter away](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/09/26/hong-kong-billionaire-offers-40-million-marriage-bounty-for-lesbian-daughter/) from her wife and partner of seven years. Because, you know, a strange man motivated by large sums of money is apparently a much, much preferable suitor than a woman motivated entirely out of love.
