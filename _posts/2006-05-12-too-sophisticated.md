![A child couldn't possibly understand this, my dear Watson.]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/05/sophisticated.jpg' | relative_url}})

Once upon a time, there was a young prince who "never cared much for princesses." Although his mother introduced him to several potential suitors, he just couldn't find someone to marry. But one fine day, he was elated to discover another handsome young prince! They married and lived happily ever after! _The end_.

Thus goes the plot of the children's picture book, [King & King](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582460612/ "Careful, it's sophisticated!"), which was _rejected_ on Tuesday by a Surrey School Board committee for being "too sophisticated" for grade three. And we shan't be introducing the children to _that_ sort of sophistication, shall we?

But fear not, kids! If King & King is too hard to follow, there's always _[The Lion King](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/ "Disney's always good for the kids")_: A tale of Mufasa, an emporer murdered at the hand of his rancorous brother---who deceives the rightful heir into believing he's responsible for his father's death. It's a classic Disney tale of overcoming personal anguish in exile, and it's available in picture book, too! Enjoy!
