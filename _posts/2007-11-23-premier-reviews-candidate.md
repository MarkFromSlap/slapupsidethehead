![Ed Stelmach Reviews Craig Chandler](/wp-content/media/2007/11/stelmach-review.jpg)

Can I hear a " **_Whaaaa?_**"

Alberta's Conservative Premier, Ed Stelmach, is reviewing a party candidate's nomination over anti-gay remarks.

Craig Chandler, who won the Calgary nomination of Calgary-Egmont this month, was [sanctioned by the Human Rights Commission](http://www.vueweekly.com/articles/default.aspx?i=4434 "The letter's really quite something!") in January over a hateful, anti-gay letter published on his website and by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council for a [libelous tirade](http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/decisions/2007/070426.htm "Though it's a boring read, admittedly.") against a gay man on his radio program.

Still, something's askew. For those of you unfamiliar with Alberta politics, being reviewed by the provincial Conservative party for anti-gay remarks is pretty darn odd. Just last year, [a private member's bill](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/anti-gay-bill-targets-teachers/ "Doesn't seem to be resurrected under the Stelmach government") that would have permitted civil marriage commissioners to deny their public services to gays and forced teachers to send out parental warnings before acknowledging the existence of same-sex marriage was defeated only through strategic means. Stelmach even [awarded the private member that introduced the bill a cabinet position](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/12/ted-morton-cabinet/ "For succinctly demonstrating party values?").

Now, I know things have changed in Alberta since the [King Ralph](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/04/ralph-to-leave-throne/ "Not the John Goodman film") days, but am I the only one that thinks this review could potentially amount to martyrdom?

Mind you, I suspect Ed simply wants to strategically distance himself further from Chandler's potentially party-harming views. I'd certainly still be reeling from what [Chandler wrote on his official political blog](http://daveberta.blogspot.com/2007/08/if-you-move-to-alberta-adapt-or-leave.html "Charming lad!") back in August: "To those of you who have come to our great land from out of province, you need to remember that you came here to our home and we vote conservative. [...] This is our home and if you wish to live here, you must adapt to our rules and our voting patterns, or leave."
