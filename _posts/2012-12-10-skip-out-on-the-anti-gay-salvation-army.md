![A skeleton bell ringer for The Salvation Army.]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/12/salvation-army.jpg' | relative_url}} "There are more worthy charities out there.")

It's about that time of year when the folks at The Salvation Army start ringing bells in front of their red kettles, soliciting donations. If you happen to see a Salvation Army kettle this holiday season, here's a few reasons you should probably give your money to a more worthwhile charity instead:

### The Salvation Army Is An Anti-Gay Political Lobby Group

The Salvation Army is Christian organisation based on Methodist theology that uses donations to oppose GLBT equality around the world. When you donate toward The Salvation Army, you're funding a political lobby group that uses its power to fight equal rights.

The Salvation Army spearheaded a well-funded effort against the decriminalization of homosexuality in New Zealand, as well as opposition to the repeal of the bizarre Section 2A of England, Wales, and Scotland's Local Government Act. This sought to forbid local authorities from publishing anything the portrays homosexuality in a positive light, and banned teaching "the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship" in the region. The organisation continues to advocate against the legal recognition of same-sex marriages and other equal rights ordinances.

### The Salvation Army Prioritizes Anti-Gay Doctrine Over Helping The Needy

In 2004, a New York municipal ordinance required all non-profit and charitable organisations to offer the same partner benefits to same-sex couples as they do for opposite-sex ones. The Salvation Army not only vocally opposed this measure, but they actually threatened to close down each of their New York soup kitchens unless they got their way. While the ordinance didn't change, Mayor Bloomberg announced that he wouldn't enforce it, and the soup kitchens remained open.

### The Salvation Army Thinks You Should Die

And if you still think that The Salvation Army's charitable activities justify their political action, here's a real kicker: In a June, 2012 radio interview, when asked about the organisation's use of violently anti-gay scripture in their 170-page official doctrine, Andrew Craibe, the Salvation Army's media relations director in Australia, [defended its inclusion](http://www.truthwinsout.org/blog/2012/06/26448/ "Hear the interview for yourself").

**Interviewer:** According to the Salvation Army, [gay people] deserve death. How do you respond to that, as part of your doctrine?

**Craibe:** Well, that's part of our belief system.

**Interviewer:** So we should die.

**Craibe:** You know, we have an alignment to the Scriptures, but that's our belief.

**Interviewer:** Wow. So we should die.

Harsh stuff, huh? So, if you're feeling extra charitable this year, consider donating directly to a local shelter, or help out reputable and transparent international charities like [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/). Let the regressive lobby groups find their money some other way.
