You're on a roll, United States! The Maryland senate passed, yesterday afternoon, a bill [granting equal marriage rights](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE81M2CW20120224?irpc=932 "You're unstoppable!") to all state residents. The governor said he will sign it into law as soon as it reaches his desk. For celebratory measure, he'll also change the state name to Marryland, why not?
