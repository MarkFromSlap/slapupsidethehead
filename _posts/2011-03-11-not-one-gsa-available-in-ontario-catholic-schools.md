None of the 29 Catholic schools in Ontario have a Gay-Straight Alliance or similar support program for gay youth, according to [an investigation by Xtra](http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/Catholic_bishops_prohibit_gaystraight_alliances_in_Ontario_schools-9760.aspx "Good work!").

GSAs are recommended by the Ontario Ministry of Education as a means of offering support to gay students, who are frequently victimized by homophobic bullying. The publicly-funded Catholic school boards, however, have chosen to ignore this recommendation along with the needs of their students.

While school board officials deny there is a ban, some were very clear as to whether a GSA would be allowed to form in their district. "The answer would be no," declared the superintendent of education for the Bruce-Grey Catholic District School Board.

Well, that sounds an awful lot like a ban to me.

Julien McArdle---a young activist from Gloucester, Ontario---agrees. He started [an online petition](http://stopthehate.ca/ "Provocatively titled, but with a good cause") earlier this month to help catch the attention of school board officials and turn up the pressure.

Good!

And if that doesn't work, students can always request the formation of Greek Salad Aficionado clubs. Only 48% of the bishops find feta cheese morally offensive.
