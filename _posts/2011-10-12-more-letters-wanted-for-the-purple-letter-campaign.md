The Purple Letter Campaign is a really great letter-writing campaign in B.C. with a simple goal: Get the government to adopt official policies to make schools safer for GLBT students and staff.

The campaign, which was started by community members Ryan Clayton and Kaitlin Burnett, asks for people like you to share your stories and encouragement by writing a letter and dropping it off (postage-free) in any of several purple mailboxes around British Columbia, or by mailing it to the address below. The letters will be collected and delivered en masse to B.C.'s Premier and Minister of Education.

Several letters are already available on the [Purple Letter Campaign website](http://purplelettercampaign.ca/ "Visit it. Now's a good time, I think."), and are well worth a read. But, if you're living in B.C. the campaign really needs your support. This is the last week for your letter to be collected in time before they're delivered to the government on October 20th. So write your letter and drop it off at [any of several designated locations](http://purplelettercampaign.ca/purple-mailbox-locations/ "There's one near you! At least telatively speaking."), or mail it to:

<address>Purple Letter Campaign<br>
#376-3495 Cambie St<br>
Vancouver, BC<br>
V5Z 4R3</address>

As Kaitlin points out, kids don't get to choose their school district---it's largely a coincidence of location---and since safe school policies are being adopted by individual school boards at inconsistent rates, it's about time a unifying policy were introduced.

Best of luck, B.C.!
