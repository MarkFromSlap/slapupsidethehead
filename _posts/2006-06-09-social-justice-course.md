British Columbia high school students have a new elective to choose from next year! The course, entitled _Social Justice Issues_, covers various topics including race, ethnicity, women's rights, and sexual orientation.

This is great news. But how do you suppose the "pro-family" scribes at LifeSite reported this?

**"Government Agrees to Mandatory Homosexual Curriculum with No Opt-Out for Students or Parents!"** _Aaaaaaah!_

Yes, that's their _actual_ headline. Of course it's completely false, as the course is an _elective_---not mandatory. But, naturally, anything coming from a group that calls themselves "pro-family" when they're actually crazily anti-gay is to be taken with a grain of salt. A big grain of make-believe space salt, anyway.

And to all students taking the new course next year, good for you! Never stop bettering yourselves.
