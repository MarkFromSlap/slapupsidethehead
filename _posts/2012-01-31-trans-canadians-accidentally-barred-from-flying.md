New airport screening rules introduced by the Harper Conservatives appears to have the side-effect of banning trans Canadians from flying entirely. Section 5.2(1)C of the Aeronautics Act [now states](http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2011/2011-08-17/html/sor-dors156-eng.html "Here's the actual government announcement") that anyone who "_does not appear to be of the gender indicated on the identification he or she presents_" is [barred from flying](http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/mercedes-allen/2012/01/new-airport-screening-regs-raise-questions-trans-canadians "A great analysis by the magnificent Mercedes Allen"). While I doubt this was a deliberate action against trans Canadians, it certainly demonstrates that they aren't in the government's consciousness. (Well, either that, or they really, _really_ like trans Canadians and never want them leave.)
