![Cameroon Judge](/wp-content/media/2008/01/cameroon-judge.jpg)

Three men in Cameroon have been sentenced to six months hard labour for being gay. (This is in addition to six months already served in jail before the trial.)

Being gay is a crime in Cameroon, carrying a maximum sentence of three years in prison. While the three men in this case aren't serving the full sentence, they weren't caught doing anything gay in particular either. I guess the judge just has some kind of super, acute gaydar.

Hey, how about that? Gaydar pings are now admissible trial evidence.
