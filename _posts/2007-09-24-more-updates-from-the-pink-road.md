![Road Slap]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/09/road-slap.jpg' | relative_url}})

Still on the road, kids! But here are some stories and updates that caught my eye:

Two high school students in Nova Scotia have turned their school into a [sea of pink](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/09/18/pink-tshirts-students.html "Not exactly my high school experience") in support of a first-year student who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. Hmm... I wonder if they'll do anything about Nova Scotia's [other bully problem](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/ "Too much to hope for?").

Speaking of Nova Scotia, a lesbian woman is [suing the province](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070918.NATS18-5/TPStory/National "Not a mommy yet") for refusing to recognize her parental status of her partner's newborn. Jamie O'Neill was told that she must adopt her son, born through invitro infertilization, because only one woman can be listed on the birth certificate. Luckily, after legal threat, the province [seems to have re-considered](http://thechronicleherald.ca/NovaScotia/897806.html "Mommies!").

Zesty's, the Vancouver comedy club in which a comedian [exploded into an anti-lesbian tirade](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/06/comedian-tirade/ "aka The Michael Richards technique"), has [been renamed](http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=4&STORY_ID=3202&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=1 "Nothings says 'retain customer loyalty' like a name change"). While owners say the name change has been underway for some time, it's not a bad strategy! Michael Richards should take note.

Finally, an Australian lesbian couple is [suing their fertilization clinic](http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2007-09-20T153032Z_01_SYD225932_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-AUSTRALIA-TWINS-COL.XML&archived=False "Didn't they get what they paid for?") after they gave birth to twins instead of just a single child. Let that be a lesson to doctors: Don't do your job too well!

Until Wednesday, kids!
