Despite a growing number of countries demonstrating that gay marriage does not destroy society and all of life as we know it, some very special types of people remain in hysterical panic, as this gem from North Carolina demonstrates.

Speaking to an anti- gay marriage crowd, David Gibbs---the lawyer best known for his fight to keep the brain-dead Terri Schiavo on life support---hypothesized about a post- gay marriage future:

> [Same-sex marriage] will open the door to unusual marriage in North Carolina. Why not polygamy, or three or four spouses? Maybe people will want to marry their pets or robots.

Their robots! It all fits into place! Why, just today I caught my robot looking at me with a distinctly amorous gaze.

Why? _Why_ did I order a robot that can love?
