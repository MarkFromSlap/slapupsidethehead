Alex Sanchez, a celebrated gay author was uninvited from speaking at several New Brunswick schools after a handful of parents complained. Sanchez was supposed to speak about tolerance, as many gay youth find themselves isolated and struggling to find acceptance.

Keith Pierce, the District 10 superintendent who made the decision to uninvite Sanchez, said that "a few parents" had complained. Because, as you know, preventing kids from learning about tolerance is the surefire way to ensure everyone turns or stays heterosexual.
