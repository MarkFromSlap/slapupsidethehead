![Craig Chandler MLA Stand](/wp-content/media/2008/02/mla-stand.jpg)

Craig Chandler, the Alberta Tory nominee rejected by Premier Ed Stelmach over anti-gay human rights violations, is desperately low on funds for his [campaign to run as an independent](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/12/tory-candidate-booted/ "It's the only option when the Alberta Tories are still to the left of your views"). Despite extensive fundraising, Chandler says he is $23,000 short:

> What we need it for is more signs [...] and for more literature that we want to send to every home in the community

Not that he really needs the money, mind you. According to Chandler's own closed, in-house polling, he's already put himself in the lead against his Calgary-Edgemont rivals.

As a former Calgarian, I don't doubt that running on an anti-gay platform would win votes in the city. But with Calgary's recent growth, new voters likely won't feel comfortable voting for someone as [radically conservative](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/11/premier-reviews-candidate/ "Seriously! Booted by the Alberta Tories. In Alberta!") as Chandler, who has been the subject of multiple human rights violations.
