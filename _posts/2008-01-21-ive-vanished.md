![Road Slap](/wp-content/media/2007/09/road-slap.jpg)

Hey kids! Well, I'm still on the road---after the filming of a trivia show, Test The Nation, on CBC. If you're reading this, it means I wasn't able to find Internet access in time for today's post, or I've met an untimely demise.

In the meantime, here are some of my personal favourite Slaps from the past half-year for you to re-read. You can think of it as one of those lame television clip shows that everyone hates.

- [Point/CounterPoint: The Dumbledore Controversy](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/10/the-dumbledore-controversy/)
- [The Self-Repressed Heterosexual](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/09/the-self-repressed-heterosexual/)
