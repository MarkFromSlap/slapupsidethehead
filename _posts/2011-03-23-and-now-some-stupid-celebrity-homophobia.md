![Victoria Jackson with a Glee](/wp-content/media/2011/03/victoria-jackson.jpg "Victoria Jackson")

Victoria Jackson, a comedian and Saturday Night Live alumni, had some not-so-nice things to say this week after watching an episode of Glee wherein two of the show's gay characters finally got an on-screen kiss.

Gay affection (very much unlike its straight counterpart) is a rarity on primetime television, so I was happy to hear we got some representation last week. Jackson, though, was less pleased, calling the sweet scene "sickening" before spouting a bunch of stuff about muslims and Hollywood agendas that I don't find particularly realistic or interesting.

Screeds like Victoria's aren't exactly rare, but hearing it come from a comedian without a wink or other hint at satire is bizarrely off-putting. I hadn't heard about it before, but apparently Victoria has decided to join the PR nightmare that is faded-celebrity-turned-political-commentator, just like Ferris Bueller's teacher and Sideshow Bob.

It's disappointing, because I actually quite like Victoria. ([UHF](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/ "It's a movie, you see.") may not be high art, but its abundance of spatulas is something magical.)

Still, no matter who espouses them, views like Victoria's are fast becoming those of a wacko minority.

Come around soon, Victoria. We'll still vaguely remember you.
