A [discriminatory law](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/12/canada-ignores-unions/) from 2004 that disallowed same-sex spouses from sponsoring their partner for Canadian citizenship was quietly overturned by the Conservative government last week. In fact, the law was reversed _so_ quietly, that it was announced by none other than NDP MP, Bill Siksay.

"Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Diane Finley has informed the Standing Committee of Citizenship and Immigration that her department's interim policy on same sex marriage [...] has been annulled," Siksay said in a press release, adding: "This is another important victory towards full equality of gay and lesbian Canadians."

Now, there's no word on why the Conservatives didn't announce this change themselves, although I guess I could try to share some insight. Let's see... They, uh, outsourced their policy announcements to the NDP?

No?

Well, perhaps Siksay's voice resounds with Canadians more. Or---Oh! I know! The parties are merging! The New Canadian Democratic Conservative Reform Alliance. Yes, that sounds about right to me.
