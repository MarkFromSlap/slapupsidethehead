Canada's historic [trans rights bill](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2010/11/charles-mcvety-throws-fits-over-gender-rights-bill/ "Which was met with the usual hysteria"), C-389, passed its third and final reading in the House of Commons on Wednesday.

The bill, sponsored by NDP MP Bill Siksay, explicitly adds gender identity to the list of identifiable groups protected against discrimination in housing, employment, and services in the Canadian Human Rights Act. While that's excellent news, what's not so excellent was the bill's narrow vote margin: [143 to 135 against](http://openparliament.ca/bills/votes/1056/ "And here are the names!").

So, which party had the most _Nay_ votes, I ask uselessly?

Why, it's the Conservatives. In fact, only six Tory MPs present on Wednesday voted in favour of the bill, with the rest voting against it (either explicitly or through pairing). The Nay votes included Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who until Wednesday hadn't previously voted on the bill.

I guess that means we shouldn't be holding our breath for his [It Gets Better](http://www.itgetsbetter.org/ "But never say never, right?") video.

The bill now moves on to the Conservative-controlled senate, where it's future is a tad uncertain. Nonetheless, trans Canadians have a reason to celebrate this week. Enjoy the victory; finally the missing T is well on its way to be added to the existing equal rights protections for GLB Canadians!
