![Kari Simpson, Batshit insane.]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/09/kari-simpson.jpg' | relative_url}} "Cuckoo! Bat poo!")

Kari Simpson, an anti-gay activist and conservative radio host, has filed a police complaint against an anti-homophobia program designed to reduce the bullying of LGBT students and foster a safer atmosphere in schools.

Slap readers may remember Kari from the time she [unsuccessfully](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/08/anti-gay-lobbyist-loses-ridiculous-complaint/ "Anti-Gay Lobbyist Loses Ridiculous Complaint") launched a [class-action human rights complaint against the B.C. Education Ministry](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/03/anti-gay-human-rights-complaint-is-a-dud/ "Anti-Gay Human Rights Complaint Is A Dud") for not introducing the "thousands" of schoolchildren who "suffer from homosexuality and other dysfunctional sexual orientations" to sexual re-orientation therapies. (Oddly enough, not one of these _thousands_ of schoolchildren seemed interested in supporting Kari's case---or in the universally rejected therapies---which was promptly thrown out by the BC Human Rights Tribunal.)

Anyway, Kari went away for a while. And that was nice. But she's back now, spearheading an attempt to get the police to investigate [Out in Schools](http://www.outinschools.com/ "A worthwhile program!"), an anti-bullying initiative designed to "facilitate discussion with youth on bullying, homophobia, and stereotypes, [giving] youth a safe space to explore these issues."

According to Kari, though, the anti-bullying motives behind Out in Schools is really just a clever front. The _real_ reason for the anti-homophobia program, she says,  is to "dupe parents and introduce children into homosexist politics and pornography," effectively recruiting children "into a sexualized culture of porn and games of debauchery."

Oh, Kari. Where would this website be without you?

So let me respond to this allegation with the only appropriate question: Is Kari actually delusional, or does she merely have an intense psychological need to get in the media despite lacking the intelligence and talent necessary to accomplish this without doing something so _astonishingly_ dumb that people can't help but become fascinated by the mounds of wiggling, manifested stupidity?

If you have a guess, I'll gleefully accept it via email, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/MarkFromSlap "Tweep!"), and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/slapupsidethehead "Booook!").

The police, by the way, have yet to comment on Kari's complaint.
