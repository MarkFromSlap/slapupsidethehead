![This Just In](/wp-content/media/2006/08/this_just_in.jpg)

Gee whiz, give a guy a microphone and you think you'd expect something _different_ from time to time, no?

Justice minister Vic Toews (who [doesn't seem](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/justice-the-vic-toews-way/ "Maybe 'Justice' means something else in his native tounge?") to have a firm grasp of justice) has once _again_ re-stated his previous re-iteration that he will _still_ not be supporting equal marriage when it comes before parliament in the fall... _again_.

After the vote to revoke same-sex marriage inevitably fails, I'm told he will simply re-run his hysterical world-has-been-thrust-into-chaos sound bytes to save energy. Can't be too conscientious, after all---what with global warming and such.
