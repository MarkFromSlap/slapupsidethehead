Don't forget: [Pink Shirt Day](http://www.pinkshirtday.ca/ "Far more successful than my personal attempt to launch Sea-Moss-Green Shirt Day."), Canada's anti-bullying campaign, is coming up in just a couple of weeks! If you don't have a pink shirt to wear, you can buy one from the [Pink Shirt Day website](http://shop.pinkshirtday.ca/ "It may not be as fashionable as a plain pink shirt, but go tell that to all the disappointed Boys and Girls at the club...") (proceeds support the Boys and Girls Club of Canada), or just do what I do and accidentally throw something red in the wash.
