![Two jailed men are sitting in their cell.]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/11/prisoners.jpg' | relative_url}} "Locking all the men together will put an end to this gay business.")

A Nigerian bill, opened for debate this month, will jail anyone who has---or bears witness to---a same-sex marriage ceremony in the country.

According to the Nigerian senate website, the bill would forbid the "coming together of persons of same sex with the purpose of living together as husband and wife or for other purposes of same sexual relationship."

The wording of the bill is such that it would likely apply to foreigners upon entry to Nigeria as well.

Well, there goes my plans to move to Nigeria and become a renowned baker of same-sex wedding cakes. Plus, I was looking forward to seeing that really amazing tourist attraction of some sort that Nigeria is so well known for.

Oh well.
