Slap reader Christian submits this bit of craziness: David Cecil, a British theatre producer, is [facing a possible prison sentence](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19595265) after staging a play criticizing Uganda's anti-gay attitudes. The performance, entitled The River and The Mountain, is about a gay businessman who is killed by his own employees. Since it clearly wasn't very well received by Ugandan authorities, I have a proposal for his next production: The Producer and The Slapees, a gripping tale about a gay theatre producer who is jailed for _putting on a freakin' play_.
