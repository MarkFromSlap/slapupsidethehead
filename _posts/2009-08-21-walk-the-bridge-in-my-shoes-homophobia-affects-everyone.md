Twenty years ago today, Alain Brosseau was walking home from his job waiting tables at the Chateau Laurier Hotel in Ottawa when he was attacked and killed by a group of men because they thought he was gay. He wasn't.

To mark the tragic event, the Ottawa community is organising a show of solidarity called [Walk The Bridge In My Shoes](http://www.capitalpride.ca/2009/events/pride2009.php "Light Up The Bridge"). It begins tonight at 7pm, starting with the viewing of a 1996 documentary at the National Art Gallery and concluding with a walk down the Alexandra Bridge, where Brosseau was dropped head-first onto a pile of rocks. Organisers encourage all participants to bring cell phones or flashlights to light up the bridge, while the Ottawa and Gatineau Chiefs of Police meet mid-way for a symbolic exchange.

Twenty years ago may seem like a while, but gay bashings are still a reality and you don't need to be gay to become a victim. These incidents will not go unnoticed; homophobia needs to be nipped in the bud.
