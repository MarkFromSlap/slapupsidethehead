![With real taser action!]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/03/game-of-life.jpg' | relative_url}} "With real taser action!")

A mother has complained to the media after discovering that her daughter was able to select two females as marriage partners in the free trial of _The Game of Life_, a computer version of the popular Milton Bradley board game.

The game is a relatively dull 1960s carry-over that lets you move a little car around a board, following a generic script starting from graduating school, to marrying, to buying a house, and finally to retirement.

"You know how kids are," the anonymous complainant told WorldNetDaily, a political website, "My daughter noticed right away---even before I did---and clicked on one of the girls instead of one of the men and then asked 'Mom, how come I can marry a woman?'"

Gee, that's awful. Although, really, I'm not sure I see what's so difficult about saying "some girls marry other girls." I guess this parent also wanted to inject all her personal objections to gay people alongside the simple, matter-of-fact explanation. Knowing how sex-obsessed anti-gay folks are, that likely involved concepts beyond what a 6-year-old is capable (or ready) to understand.

So, rather than simply omitting her objections and just acknowledging the reality of the situation, the unnamed mother went and did the next easiest thing: She went to the game's website and tried to persuade the administrators to censor the game. But---the poor dear---her publicly viewable complaints were promptly deleted for being inappropriate. "I had no idea how insidious they were being with pushing the homosexual agenda," she remarked.

The 1960s version of the game, incidentally, also "pushes the homosexual agenda" by allowing players to put two blue or two pink pegs in their little car.
