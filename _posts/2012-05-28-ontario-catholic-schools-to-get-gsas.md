![Dracula congratulations you with a]({{'/wp-content/media/2012/05/condraculations.jpg' | relative_url}} "Condraculations!")  
I admit it. I jumped the gun with my [Congratulalien](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2011/07/ontario-catholic-schools-to-get-glbt-support-groups/ "Ontario Catholic Schools To Get GLBT Support Groups") last year. When the Ontario government announced that all schools---including Catholic schools---must allow the formation of student-run GLBT support groups, I took that to mean students would finally be getting Gay-Straight Alliances, a proven strategy to improve student safety and reduce instances of teen suicide due to bullying. Having endured twelve years of Catholic schooling myself, I perhaps should have been able to predict what happened instead. While students weren't explicitly denied support groups, the Catholic school board forbade these groups from being called GSAs and continued to meddle with their direction. When students requested a GSA, they were forced to accept a strange replacement---generic support groups where any discussion of gay issues would be ostensibly halted as being not _inclusive_ enough.

Last week, after substantial pressure (and a tad more controversy than I'd expect in this decade), the Ontario government introduced a bill that unambiguously mandates GSAs in any school where students request one. That includes the name and direction that it implies. With all indications pointing toward a speedy passage, I hope that I'm not premature in issuing a most sincere **Condraculations!**
