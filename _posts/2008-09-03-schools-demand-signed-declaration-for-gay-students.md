Four schools in Auckland, New Zealand, have barred students from taking same-sex partners to the prom unless they sign a contract declaring they are homosexual, according to the New Zealand Human Rights Commission.

Sarafin Dillon, an education officer for Rainbow Youth, was disappointed by the reports, saying that forcing students to sign contracts would only increase "the ridicule and the whispers" that gay students face.

A spokesperson for the schools responded by nervously wielding a torch and backing into a corner, stuttering "Reveal yourselves! Where are you? Show yourselves! _GAAAAH!_"
