![Gay Bird Flu](/wp-content/media/2008/01/gay-flu.jpg)

Nissim Ze'ev, a Member of Knesset in Jerusalem, announced last week that gays and lesbians are "an epidemic [that] should be dealt with like the Health Ministry deals with bird flu."

The bizarre proclamation came during a law and constitution committee as MKs were discussing a controversial bill that would ban gays from holding protest marches in the region. MK Zehava Gal-On called Ze'ev's comments a revelation of ignorance.

And with that, the nutty theatrics displayed in Canada's House of Commons don't seem that---_cluck_---bad by comparison.

_Gobble._
