![At least until next year, when we can pull you out altogether.](/wp-content/media/2009/09/teacher-earplugs.jpg "At least until next year, when we can pull you out altogether.")

Alberta's strange new law requiring teachers to notify parents before tackling any lessons dealing with sexual orientation has been delayed until next year so that the school boards can prepare formal procedures.

The Alberta Teacher Association as well as several large municipal school boards was against this bill from the start, but the provincial Conservative government has so far been adamant that the law is necessary for parents to be able to pull their children out of classes, preventing them from learning anything about gay issues.

The law was part of a revision to the Human Rights Act, which means that any teachers who violate the new law will see themselves before the Alberta Human Rights Commission.

The whole thing is a [bad idea](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/06/alberta-puts-the-chill-on-gay-classroom-topics/ "But I've said enough about it already..."), so sparing an extra year's worth of children from all this is welcome news. Too bad it's not delayed indefinitely.
