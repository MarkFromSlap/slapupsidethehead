Someone call a nanny! Alberta's hysterical temper-tantrum over same-sex marriage is still going strong, apparently. Ted Morton (MLA and **_super bigot extraordinaire_** ) resumed debate on [Bill 208](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/anti-gay-bill-targets-teachers/ "Otherwise known as Waaah! Waaah!") Friday. The bill, which was [presumed dead](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/victoria-day-update/ "Dead, in the same sense of zombies") after legislature ended back in spring, was granted a surprise resurrection.

Here's what the bill will do, if passed:

- Allow civil marriage commissioners to refuse their public services to gays
- Allow teachers to refuse to acknowledge the existence of same-sex marriage in Canada
- Force teachers to hand out "parental warnings" if they _do_ choose to acknowledge reality
- Remove all punishment for an individual "exercising their beliefs" against gay marriage.

Un-freaking-believable!

Julie Lloyd, a local activist, is terrified.

> The effects of this bill, should it become law in Alberta, would be devastating for gays and lesbians.
> 
> [Bill 208], if passed, would allow employers to fire gays and let landlords evict gay tenants with impunity because they're "exercising a belief against same-sex marriage."

Of course, the bill is also grossly unconstitutional, and certainly wouldn't survive a court challenge (assuming the obscure [notwithstanding clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notwithstanding_Clause "aka the 'constitution doesn't matter' clause") isn't used---which [Alberta has done before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notwithstanding_Clause#Use_of_the_clause "Utterly shameful") to prevent court challenges to a ban on same-sex marriage from 2000-2005). But, really, even if the bill doesn't survive, how much more of this hemorrhaging fit can Teddy produce?

Yeah, that's totally a rhetorical question.
