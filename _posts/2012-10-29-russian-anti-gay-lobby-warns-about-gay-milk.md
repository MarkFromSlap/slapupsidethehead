![Gay Brand Homo Milk: Taste The Gay](/wp-content/media/2012/10/gay-brand-milk.jpg "Taste the Gay, Every Day!")

Other countries take note. If you enact crazy anti-gay laws forbidding any positive portrayals of homosexuality, here's what you can expect to happen:

A popular brand of milk is being accused of illegally promoting homosexuality in St-Petersburg, Russia. The milk, a PepsiCo-owned brand, features a jolly dairy farmer, standing in a lovely green field beside a rather happy-looking cow, with a rainbow arching across the sky.

"A rainbow appeared on the [milk] cartons, a world-renowned symbol of the gay movement," said Anatoly Artukh, a member of the anti-gay lobby group People's Council. "That immediately put me on alert."

Put him on alert for what, exactly? That someone, somewhere is going to sit down for breakfast, see a rainbow on their milk carton and think: "Hey, you know what I've never questioned before? My sexuality. Maybe I'll call that number I saw written on the wall of that truck stop's men's room."

Heaven forbid a _real_ rainbow should ever appear across the sky in St-Petersburg. The meteorologists would have quite a bit of explaining to do.

Of course, here in Canada, milk that has undergone the [homogenization process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenized_milk "No homo for me, though. I prefer skim.") is marketed as "homo milk." And it's marketed to children. I know a lot of people who drank homo milk growing up that didn't turn out gay, but then again---there wasn't a rainbow on the carton.
