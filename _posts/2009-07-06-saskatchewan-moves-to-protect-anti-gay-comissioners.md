![They used to have a door-to-door campaign, but it resulted in too many damaged contact lenses.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/07/eyepokitarian.jpg' | relative_url}} "They used to have a door-to-door campaign, but it resulted in too many damaged contact lenses.")

The conservative Saskatchewan Party has decided to introduce legislation that will allow government-licensed civil marriage commissioners to deny their services to same-sex couples in the province.

Civil marriage commissioners perform public, non-religious marriage ceremonies for couples who do not wish to have a denominational wedding. They are also certified to issue marriage licenses themselves.

The legislation is coming as a response to a couple of marriage commissioners who refused to offer their public services to gay couples, claiming that issuing a same-sex civil marriage would violate their religious beliefs. Considering they're not performing ceremonies on behalf of their personal religion, that may be a wee bit of a stretch.

But, hey, if this legislation takes effect, I can also refuse to serve anti-gay people, right?
