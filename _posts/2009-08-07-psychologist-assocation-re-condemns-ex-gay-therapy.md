![To be published in the esteemed medical journal,]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/08/apa-report.jpg' | relative_url}} "To be published in the esteemed medical journal, ")

The American Psychological Association has finished a two-year review of their 1997 policy denouncing reparative, conversion therapy for gays. The final verdict: "There is no evidence that sexual orientation change efforts work."

This latest investigation, launched in 2007, reviewed over 80 studies on the subject of gay conversion therapies published between 1960 to present. The 183-page conclusion, which was released on Wednesday, states that "contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation."

The APA removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973, and has warned that any attempt to change sexual orientation can be harmful to the healthy development of individuals. With this latest report, the APA also condemns non-professionals who portray homosexuality as a developmental disorder, saying that they should instead "increase family and school support and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth."

While the report is all well and good, this exhaustive review really just reinforces what medical professionals have already known for years: gay conversion therapies don't work because there's nothing to cure. Whether you're gay, lesbian, straight, or anything in-between, you're every bit as worthy of love as anyone else!
