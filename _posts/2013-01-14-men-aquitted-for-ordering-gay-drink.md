![Gaydar Tip-Off #113: A man walks into a bar and orders the drink to the left. Watch closely! If he gives it to his boyfriend, he's probably gay.]({{'/wp-content/media/2013/01/girly-drink.jpg' | relative_url}})

Two Cameroon men who were sentenced to five years in prison for "looking gay" after ordering Bailey's Irish Cream have been acquitted of the charges by an appeals court. The two had already passed a year of their sentence before the acquittal.

Homosexuality is illegal in Cameroon, and is subject to harsh penalties. Ordering Bailey's Irish Cream hardly seems like conclusive evidence of being gay, though. I mean, yes, it's from the country that brought us Billy Elliot and tiny rainbow-obsessed men in green tailcoats, but that doesn't make Guinness and bar fighting particularly gay, does it?
