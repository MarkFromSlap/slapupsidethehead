![It's a crueler cruller.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/08/tim-hortons-cruller.jpg' | relative_url}} "It's a crueler cruller.")

Here's an odd bit of donut drama. Tim Hortons, Canada's largest fast food chain, (yes---even bigger than McDonald's) was spotted officially sponsoring an anti-gay political rally to be held in Rhode Island, U.S.A. next week.

National Organization for Marriage, the anti-gay organisation responsible for last spring's silly ad campaign [equating gay marriage to a violent storm](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/04/anti-gay-lobbyists-battens-down-the-hatches/ "The gays tore the roof off my house and uprooted all my trees!"), had approached Tim Hortons to sponsor a push for heterosexual-only marriage. Tim Hortons, oddly, obliged---apparently violating their own policy:

> Tim Hortons does not sponsor individuals, those representing religious groups, political affiliates, book endoresements or traveling sports teams.

Thankfully, a few hours after word reached the online world, Tim Hortons quickly pulled their support entirely, releasing a statement and minimal apology, offering regret for any misunderstandings.

Quick and sweet. Just like a timbit.
