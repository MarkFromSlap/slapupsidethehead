![Hand it in with your TPS report.](/wp-content/media/2009/06/gay-coworker.jpg "Hand it in with your TPS report.")

A study on gay employees in Canada has shown that there are still barriers when it comes to advancing one's career.

The Catalyst study, sponsored by the Bank of Nova Scotia, found that less than half of gay workers felt their coworkers were very comfortable with gay employees, and fewer than ten percent felt coworkers were informed about the issues gay employees face. The study also revealed a gender discrepancy when it comes to being closeted at work. While only about five percent of men are completely closeted at work, the figure is more than doubled for gay women at twelve percent.

Combined, these attitudes have resulted in gay people being passed over for promotions, and exclusion from business networks.

Of course, gay workers will always be welcome here at **_InterSlap&nbsp;Enterprises,&nbsp;Inc._**.
