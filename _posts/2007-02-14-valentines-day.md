![Valentine's Day Update](/wp-content/media/2007/02/valentines-day.jpg)

Happy Valentine's Day, kids! Love it or loathe it, it's an existent holiday and that can only mean one thing: It's time for me to post a lazy update on old stories!

## Alvaro Orozco Might Stay

Alvaro Orozco, the Nicaraguan man who was to be deported for [not being "gay enough"](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/not-gay-enough/) has been allowed to stay in Canada for two more months. His lawyer is using that time to arrange an application for citizenship based on "humanitarian and compassionate grounds."

If you'd like to help Alvaro, visit [his website](http://orangehabitat.com/alvaro/ "Help the kid out, why not?") for information on what you can do.

## Canadians Like Gays, But Not Too Close

While nearly one in five Canadians would [dislike a gay neighbour](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/love-thy-neighbour/ "Love thy neighbour?"), a sizable majority would like to see those gay neighbours explicitly protected by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

According to a recent Angus Reid poll, 62% of Canadians responded that they'd support explicit provisions in the Charter to ensure equality for everyone regardless of their sexual orientation. In addition, 54% of respondents said that the final word on issues involving Charter rights should be decided by the courts, and not parliament.

Hey, do you think that means we'll be getting our [Court Challenges Program](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/go-fund-yourself/ "The thing that USED to ensure the government couldn't revoke human rights on a whim") back?

Well, until Friday, have a great Valentine's Day!
