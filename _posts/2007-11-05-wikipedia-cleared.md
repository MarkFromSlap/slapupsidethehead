Three French nationals have lost their defamation lawsuit against Wikipedia. The three sued Wikipedia for 69,000 euros each after an article about them claimed they were gay activists.

Wait... Being called a gay activist could be worth â‚¬69k in reparation? I know the case lost in France, but it's gotta be uncontested in Canada! If I'm play my cards right, _Cha-ching!_
