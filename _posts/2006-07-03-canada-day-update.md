![The Canada Day Update](/wp-content/media/2006/07/canada_day.jpg)

Well, it's the long weekend! And to celebrate, I've prepared this amazing **Canada Day Update** in advance to let you know how some of the stories I've been tracking have progressed. Uh, also I'd like to take some time off to bask in the hot Canadian sun...

## Gay Mounties Wed

Jason Tree and David Conners, the two gay Mounties whose [marriage plans](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/mounties-get-their-man/ "Even I used that 'Get their Man' joke") made international news, have wed! (Congrats, guys!) When pestered by all sorts of media, Tree said he was confused by all the attention their little wedding has been getting.

> We don't see our wedding as anything different or special. Our goal was to get married, not have an international media story.

Oh, and Conservative MPs are still [disallowed to comment](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/06/out-of-town-update/ "Because our prime minister trusts his caucus so") on the event. You know, because our crazy prime minister trusts his caucus so.

## Homophobia Honored

Although Toronto's Ryerson University has stated it [now regrets its decision](http://www.macleans.ca/topstories/politics/news/shownews.jsp?content=n061961A "Why does 'smart' always come too late?"), an honorary degree was still [conferred to a notorious homophobe](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/06/pride-week-quiz/ "Sigh."), Margaret Somerville---at the same time as the city's Pride Week opening ceremonies, might I add. During her acceptance speech, Margaret tried to comfort the protesters at the event.

> As we all know, some people are hurt by some of my views. I want to say that, although I believe that I must stand by those views, I genuinely regret the hurt that causes them.

Gee, Margaret. That's so touching. Thanks for accepting a degree that first the students, then the university itself didn't want to give you.

## No Jail Time for Gay Attack

Nick Demers, who [punched a gay man in the face](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/04/edmontons-punch-in-the-face-dress-code/ "Do I feel any safer now?") for dressing colourfully during Edmonton's Pride Week celebrations last year just [received a six-month conditional sentence](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/06/21/pride-week-attack-.html) for the attack. That means no jail time, folks. But at least his court-ordered apology _sounded_ sincere. That ought to be enough to satisfy everyone, right?

Well, regardless. That, kiddos, is the Canada Day Update! **Happy Canada Day long weekend, everyone!**
