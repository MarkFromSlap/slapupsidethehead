An entire Lutheran congregation in Newmarket, Ontario has been suspended over the hiring of a gay associate pastor.

Lionel Ketola, a gay, legally married man of faith, was ordained last May in a ceremony that drew more than 300 well-wishing parishoners. However, this did not sit well with Bishop Michael Pryse of the Eastern Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, who officially informed the Holy Cross Lutheran Church this week that they have been suspended over the hiring.

The Synod's actions are reportedly based on a lesser known biblical passage: _And Jesus gathered his followers and spoke to them: "Eeew! A gay! Could someone get him out of here, please? Anyone? Seriously, I'll turn this church around and there'll be no heaven for anyone. There we go; thank you, sir."_
