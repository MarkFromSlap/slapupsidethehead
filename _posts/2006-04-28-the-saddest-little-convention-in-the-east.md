![The Family Coalition Party of Ontario Convention](/wp-content/media/2006/04/family_coalition_convention.png)

It's that time of year again! Grab the kids---or, uh, at least some great, great grandparents that are especially set in their ways---and spend a full, long day at _The Family Coalition Party of Ontario's Annual Convention_!

What's that? We missed it? _Awww_... Well, there's always next year, I suppose.

The convention took place at the _glamourous_ Mississauga Best Western Hotel last Saturday to an audience of a whopping **50** people. Attendance was, of course, mandatory for most of those present, and cost $25.00.

So what happened at this full-day conference? According to the [FCP's kooky website](http://www.familyparty.on.ca/ "Website by kooks, for kooks"), it included prayers, various talk about how society has collapsed since the equal marriage bill became law, and lectures from special _celebrity_ speakers. No, not Brangelina, just the _magnificently_ delusional [Dawn Stefanowicz](http://www.google.ca/search?q=Dawn+Stefanowicz "Because all gay people are exactly the same!"), who actively preaches how all gay people are HIV-positive, promiscuous, and child molesters. Sweet gal, that one.

Although the party doesn't have a _moray eel in the Sahara_'s hope in the of winning a seat in [Ontario parliament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Ontario "Da Legislative Assembly of Ontario, from the all-knowing Wikipedia") (thanks to their radical lobbying to strip rights from gays), they do posses an amazing psychological weapon. The following paradox, found on their website, may make a rational person's head explode.

> [Party members] can not be involved with any party that does not **respect fundamental human rights** , or with any party that does not **defend the traditional family**.

"Defend the traditional family," from their actions, clearly means "attack and malign the gays." Mon cerveau! Il a fondu!
