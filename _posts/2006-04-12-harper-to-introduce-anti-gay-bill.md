![Harper's To-Do List](/wp-content/media/2006/04/harper_todo.jpg)

Newly elected prime minister Stephen Harper (or little Bush---that adorable tyke), has vowed to introduce legislation revoking same-sex marriage in Canada. Although this bill [would be unconstitutional](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/01/25/lawyer-samesex050125.html "10 out of 10 Lawyers agree!") and [only 30% of Canadians](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canadavotes2006/national/2006/01/24/vote-poll060124.html "Canadians are a smart group, sometimes") polled said they want it to happen, he's still trying his best. He's such a little trooper!

Of course, the anti-gay crazies are positively salivating at the opportunity to get all "holier than thou" on our collective ass again. Gwen Landolt of the right-wing Christian lobby group, REAL Women of Canada, was busy pretending that society had been thrust into chaos since the equal marriage law. Chaos!

> What about the question of clergy? What are their rights? And what are the rights of children?

Gee, those are, uh, good questions, Gwen. Just let me fiddle with the dials on my super _go backwards in time machine_ where you can get them all settled... again.
