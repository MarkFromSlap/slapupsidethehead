Stephen Dunne, a 30-year-old Boston man, refused to answer a question on his state's bar exam involving the property rights of a married lesbian couple. After learning he didn't score high enough to pass the exam and earn his lawyer's license, he's now doing the only thing he knows how: He's suing.

Dunne, a self-proclaimed Christian, blamed his failure on the question's hypothetical lesbian couple, calling their marriage and property rights dispute "morally repugnant and patently offensive." He said the question was designed as part of a greater conspiracy to promote "secular humanism's homosexual agenda."

Last I checked, same-sex marriage is a legal reality in Massachusetts.

So far, there's no word on whether Dunne will also be suing for the non-gay questions he got wrong.
