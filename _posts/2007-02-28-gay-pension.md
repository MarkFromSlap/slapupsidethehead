![Timely Court Ruling]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/02/timely-court-decision.jpg' | relative_url}})

Remember [George Hislop](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/pension-battle/)? He's involved in a lengthy court battle to get same-sex survivor's benefits. And he's dead.

Sadly, Hislop died in October 2005 while waiting for the supreme court's decision. But luckily for him, the final ruling is coming tomorrow! At last! Uh, not that there's much he could do with his partner's pension if it's awarded now. A good tombstone polishing, maybe.

Incidentally, our beloved federal government is the party fighting the case, arguing that the elderly surviving partners of gay relationships should _not_ be awarded their partner's pensions retroactively. After all, it's not like gay people have ever paid money into the Canada Pension Plan. Oh---wait...
