How about I share some encouraging news for a change? The Québec government has officially launched their _Lutte contre l'homophobie_, a five-year program to combat homophobic bullying and discrimination.

The program, which was announced in 2008 but came into effect last month, has seven million dollars allocated toward over 60 anti-homophobia measures, including support for independent community organisations. (Organisations that would like to apply for financial support have until December 1st under this program.)

While I don't expect this will rid the province of homophobia overnight, I'm confident it will help---and it's a far cry from government policies that actively oppose equal rights for GLBT citizens.

Good for Québec!
