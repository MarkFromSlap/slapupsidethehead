![Ann Coulter giving a speech with bags of money in the corner.](/wp-content/media/2010/08/ann-coulter.jpg "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...")

Ann Coulter, a professional controversialist and media darling of the extreme right-wing in the U.S., has been dropped as the keynote speaker for an ultra socially conservative  website's conference because organizers found her too "unconservative."

This conclusion was reached after WorldNetDaily, the conference organizers, discovered that Coulter was also a paid speaker at Homocon, a different conference held by gay Republicans.

So, there you go. To WND, simply speaking to gay people---even if it's for money---is enough to undo a career of intolerance and queer-slandering and forever define yourself as a Liberal.
