![A Bond-ish villian declares: The pat-downs are in place. Muha. Our homosexual agenda is advancing exactly as planned! Muh-Muha!](/wp-content/media/2010/12/bond-villain.jpg "They're on to us! ")

Invasive airport security pat-downs are part of a "wide-scale homosexual agenda," at least according to Eugene Delgaudio, an elected Virginia politician.

In an email alert sent from the Public Advocate, an anti-gay lobby group, Delgaudio said the pat-downs were the natural next step in the TSA's non-discrimination hiring policy: "The next TSA official that gives you an 'enhanced pat down,'" he wrote, "could be a practicing homosexual secretly getting pleasure from your submission."

Egad! They're on to us, kids! Delgaudio has somehow gotten a hold of pages 287 and 288 of the Gay Agenda and is fast discovering that _everything that annoys him_ is all the gays' fault. It would be wise, at this point, to quickly dispose of any physical copies of The Agenda; we'll discuss what to do to correct and contain this leak at our biannual meeting in January. See you then!
