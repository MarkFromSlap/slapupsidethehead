Prince Edward Island has finally allowed private marriage commissioners to perform marriages in the province, and the first such commissioner, Jim Culbert, was very proud to have his first ceremony be a same-sex marriage!

> It's great to be able to see people finally getting things that they really would like in their life and not have to hide about it. You know, they can be openly married and go home and say, "Hey, you know, we really are people."

This wonderful attitude is a far cry from Alberta, which [almost passed legislation](http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=bills_bill&selectbill=208 "Click for unbelievable nonsense") this spring that would have made commissioner discrimination against gay and lesbian couples perfectly legal. So, congratulations to Jim, the new couple, and Prince Edward Island! Here's to not being crazy bigots!
