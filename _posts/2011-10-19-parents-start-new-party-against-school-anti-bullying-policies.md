![A reporter asks a candidate a question:]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/10/school-board-candidate.jpg' | relative_url}} "We're talking about schools here; how many issues can there be?")

A new civic party has been started in Burnaby, British Columbia in direct opposition to some new anti-homophobic bullying initiatives introduced by the Burnaby School Board trustees last June.

Calling themselves Parents' Voice, the party is in opposition to the board's existing anti-bullying policy on gender identity and sexual orientation, which they call "homosexual propoganda." Actually, _opposition_ might be a bit of an understatement. The issue is the party's entire platform, and if elected, the party is vowing to make revoking the policy their only priority.

The party is running five candidates: Homara Ahmad, Charter Lau, Helen Ward, Gordon  World, and Long Xue.

Burnaby, incidentally, is the 14th school board in British Columbia to have adopted a sorely needed anti-homophobia and anti-bullying policy. While it's important that these board policies remain in place, there is work underway to get the provincial government to adopt a consistent, province-wide policy. If that's something you'd like to support, today is the last day to participate in the [Purple Letter Campaign](http://purplelettercampaign.ca/ "Hurry!"), so I encourage you to check it out!
