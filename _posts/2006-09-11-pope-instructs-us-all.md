![All Hail Xartak!](/wp-content/media/2006/09/xartak.jpg)

Pope Benedict, fresh from [blaming Canada's low birth rate](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/chilling-message/ "I'm still scratching my head over that one...") on same-sex marriage, has once again instructed lawmakers to strip away gay rights. Because, you know, it just _tears families apart_ to think that one could allow loving gay couples to equally enjoy the legal institution of civil marriage. The paperwork is just _far_ too sacred, I'm told.

Anyway, the pope's latest effort in his long [history of creative phrasing](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/fun-with-words/ "It's really quite amusing to watch")---delivered, of course, from his throne in the resplendent Vatican palace---goes like this: "In the name of tolerance, your country has had to endure the folly of the redefinition of spouse."

Well, _folly_ is a little unnecessary and... Wait a minute here. Let me [check something](http://www.answers.com/spouse "From the good conglomerators at answers.com")...

> **spouse** (_noun_): A marriage partner; a husband or wife.

Nope, nope. Seems about the same to me.

Despite the pope's ever-so-convincing speech, Gilles Marchildon of [EGALE Canada](http://www.egale.ca/ "It's a French acronym, if you're wondering"), had to suggest that lawmakers follow the, uh, law:

> We don't have a state religion in Canada. Just as government doesn't instruct the Catholic Church how to celebrate communion, the church shouldn't instruct politicians on who can get married.

Very true. Because as unholy as the Charter of Rights must be, it does appear to guarantee citizen equality. Sorry, Pope of Canada.
