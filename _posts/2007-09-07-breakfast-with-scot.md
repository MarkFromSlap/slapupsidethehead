![Road Slap]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/09/road-slap.jpg' | relative_url}})

Hey kids! I'm on the other side of the country for a little while to defend my master's thesis, so I'm posting my very first _Road Slap_ today! (For the astute, a Road Slap is just like any other post on this site, but thanks to soul-sucking jetlag, lacks illustrations or humour of any kind.)

While leafing through my usual news stories, I caught a handful promoting Breakfast With Scot. The Canadian-produced comedy film is a sweet tale about a closeted gay couple, each with "manly" sports professions, that unexpectedly becomes the guardians to a sissy and flamboyant 11-year old boy. Actor Tom Cavanagh shared what I thought were some nice insights into what the story is about:

> I like the central conceit of the story. These two fellas who draw no attention to their private lives and sexual orientation are put in a position where they have to look after this young boy who doesn't really understand what it means to be gay or straight, who is just being himself.

The story has been praised by reviewers, described as a film that that "celebrate[s] the uniqueness of children, and how they can teach adults."

The anti-gay lobby, on the other hand, has burst capillaries over the movie's production. Their reaction has been as funny as it is illogical: Both the Canadian Family Action Coalition and the American-based Americans For Truth Against Homosexuality started a public boycott of the NHL (whose Toronto Maple Leaf's logo was licensed for the film), and bombared Richard Peddie---president of the Leaf's---with emails he called "raw," "live," and "disappointing." Brian Rushfeldt, head of CFAC, even went on record with this batty rant:

> [The NHL's endorsement of the film] is the epitome of almost evil intent. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the entire situation is that an 11-year-old boy is being promoted as a poster child for gay sex.

I've already made light of the [phenomenal leaps of logic](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/nhl-harassed-boycotted/ "Would a flowchart help?") required to reach this conclusion, but considering that the lobbyists' NHL boycott has failed so completely, I think it's demonstrative of what the anti-gay industry has become: a cantankerous, disconnected minority.

So, for those available to see Sunday's screening (6:30 pm Scotiabank 1 in Toronto), go and enjoy film; for those that aren't, enjoy the NHL season. Others have tried to use their muscle, however atrophied, to ensure you would do neither.
