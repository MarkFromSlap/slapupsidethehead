![That's how they'll be given out, too.](/wp-content/media/2009/08/albanian-marriage-license.jpg "That's how they'll be given out, too.")

Albanian Prime Minister, Sali Berisha, has proposed the nationwide legalisation of same-sex marriage last week. This would be a massive step forward for the country, where homosexuality was illegal as recent as 1995.

The move has surprised even gay rights groups, who had been fighting in smaller steps---most recently calling for laws against workplace discrimination.

Of course, there will still be a lot of work to be done in order to change deeply held misconceptions about gay people in Albania, but if all goes as it should, soon the country will achieve a level of equal rights matched only by the awesomeness of [their flag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania "Hey, Adil should see this!")!
