![Pride Flag Vacation]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/06/flag-vacation.jpg' | relative_url}})

Officials and community members in Niagara Falls have been left scratching their heads after the first-ever gay pride flag to be flown over city hall went missing a mere four hours after its raising ceremony.

So far, there's no word on what happened to the flag or if it has been replaced. Although, after years of following these sorts of stories, I think it's clear who took it: Mutant seagulls.
