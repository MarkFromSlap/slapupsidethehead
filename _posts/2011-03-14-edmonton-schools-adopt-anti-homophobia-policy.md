![In 2028, the city of Edmonton, having finally broken free, sailed the world.]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/03/edmonton-breakaway.jpg' | relative_url}} "You can leave the politicians, though.")

Let's start the week with some good news, why not?

The Edmonton Public School District has voted 8-1 to adopt a zero-tolerance policy toward homophobia in each of its schools, making it the first city in the province to officially take such a stance.

The new policy, which will now be researched and drafted by a committee, will ensure that GLBT students in Edmonton will have the support systems they need, and that GLBT staff cannot be discriminated against for their sexual orientation.

Edmonton has always been a little more forward-thinking than other cities in Alberta when it comes to equal rights for the GLBT community, having elected the provinces' first gay politician (Michael Phair) in 1992, and generally supporting equal rights earlier than elsewhere in the province. It also produced me, Mark, which is _very_ foward-thinking, if I may say so.

At any rate, congratulations Edmonton for supporting students' rights and helping put an end to homophobic bullying! Here's hoping other school boards follow suit.
