Well, I guess even studying history doesn't mean you won't repeat it!

An irrationally anti-gay history prof at [Cape Breton University](http://www.capebretonu.ca/) has been suspended for two weeks after posting material inciting hatred and violence toward gays. A separate human rights complaint has also been filed for his old-timey hate.

David Mullen, whom I shall call Davey (we can be chummy like that, can't we?), received a polite letter from Shane Wallis at the university's Sexual Diversity Centre requesting to please "separate your [anti-gay] views from your academic website," in accordance with the university's discrimination and harassment policy. While the request was civil and respectful, Davey responded, well... [somewhat angrily](http://www.sleepyoldbear.com/15%20February.htm "Warning: Anti-Gay Link!"):

> This is my web site and I do as I please with it.  
> I do not subscribe to the propaganda of the homosex movement.  
> I am not afraid of people who engage in sexually deviant behaviour.  
> I am critical of their disastrous choices. [... blah, blah, etc, etc.]  
> Homosex is a repudiation of nature and the apotheosis of unbridled desire.
> 
> Request denied.

Davey then attached a picture of himself wielding a _semi-automatic rifle_ above the phrase "nobody attacks me with impunity," and changed Mr. Wallis' signature to read "Sexual Perversity Centre Coordinator." A clever wordsmith, that one!

Hey, I wonder if when Davey's views are inevitably written into the history books as being as wrong, wrong, wrong, he'll still have to teach it? That'd be neat!
