![](/wp-content/media/2008/09/tory-candidate.jpg "It's just unexpected, that's all.")

Vancouver's Lorne Mayencourt, a gay Liberal MLA with a strong record of supporting AIDS research and anti-bullying campaigns, is running for a seat in the federal election as a... Conservative candidate?

Yes, after vehemently opposing equal marriage rights, fighting against adding gays to protective hate crimes legislation, [axing](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/tories-cut-equality-funding/ "don't axe me why.") the minority protections in the court challenges program, appointing an [anti-gay lobby member](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/darrel-reid-govt-gig/ "Not just someone who hung around in the lobby, either.") to an influential government job, appointing a Supreme Court Judge that had [formerly called equal marriage unconstitutional](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/new-ontario-judge/ "A judge who thinks equality is unconstitutional. Neat."), and even [drafting a bill](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/04/religious-bill-drafted/ "though, in fairness, it wasn't officially introduced.") that would make it legal for public servants to discriminate against gay people, the Tories have welcomed an openly gay MLA from a provincial Liberal party.

While I don't take this as evidence that the Conservatives are no longer hostile toward gays, I do think it would be nice to have a gay influence among the Tory seats. If it came down to it.
