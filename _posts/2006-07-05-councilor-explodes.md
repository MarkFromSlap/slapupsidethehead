![Toronto's City Council Votes](/wp-content/media/2006/07/council_vote.jpg)

Have you ever wondered how a crazy, anti-gay city councilor would react to AIDS prevention programs? Well, wonder no longer, folks! Rob Ford, a Toronto city councilor, voted against granting city funds toward AIDS education. And while that's not particularly shocking, his five minute, on-the-record, angry rant is _magnificently_ loony:

> There are people dying _every day_ of cancer, diabetes---all the other diseases. Why are we catering to [AIDS groups]? It's very preventable! If you're not doing needles and **you're not gay** , you **won't get AIDS** , probably. That's the bottom line! And that's preventable.
> 
> The general public does _not_ agree with this [motion]. They think it's a complete farce, ridiculous! This is so embarrassing!

Uh, yeah, because there's nothing quite like ranting about [the GRIDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRIDS "Yes, that's what it used to be called") to argue against funding for **_AIDS education_**.

Anyway, after Robby's five minutes of angry time, the other councilors cut off his mic. Kyle Rae, the gay councilor whom Robby ridiculed for "condoning" AIDS funding, had this on-the-record response:

> I don't think it is worthy of this council to respond to the comments we heard a few moments ago. There are some who can be educated, and some who cannot.

Good on ya, Kyle. Oh, and the motion to fund AIDS education passed overwhelmingly.
