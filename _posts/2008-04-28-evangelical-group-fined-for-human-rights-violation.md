Connie Heintz, a Christian worker at a shelter for developmentally delayed adults, has won a human rights case against her former employer.

After Connie's co-workers at Christian Horizons discovered she was a lesbian, she was forced to quit, describing the work atmosphere as the "worst time of my life." She was harassed, threatened with dismissal, and falsely accused of abusing the residents she was caring for. Connie, who is deeply religious, was awarded 18 months of her old salary as compensation.

Anti-gay groups are already up in arms; A LifeSite article was quick to accuse the human rights tribunal of stifling religious freedom---once again, under the assumption that gay people and religion are somehow mutually exclusive. I contest that. Connie was a devout Christian who cared deeply about the underlying mission of the organisation. For her employers to claim that having a gay employee in their ranks is somehow against their faith is a stretch. (Unless, of course, Jesus decreed something I'm not yet familiar with: "Thou shalt fireth the gay ones like a grain is shed from its stalk, for they be not fit to care for thy developmentally delayede adultes.")

Christian Horizons receives public funds from the government and is contractually required to follow Canada's human rights laws.
