Well, it's Thanksgiving here in Canada, so I'm taking the day off. For those unfamiliar with Canadian Thanksgiving, I've prepared some posts with [Canadian Thanksgiving Trivia](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/tag/thanksgiving/ "The U.S. version of the holiday is weird!") a few years back. Even now, I'm learning new differences between the holiday and its U.S. counterpart. For example, did you know that U.S. Thanksgiving desserts are traditionally made with pumpkins? Since all pumpkins have long frozen up here this time of year, we always make pies out of citrouilles (or "rooeys" as we call them). Also, since pilgrims never settled this far north, our traditional thanksgiving symbol is the nun.

Anyway, I hope you all have a lot to be thankful for this year. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!
