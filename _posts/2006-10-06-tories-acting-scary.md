![Conservatives Aren't Scary, Are They?](/wp-content/media/2006/10/not_scary.jpg)

Justice Minister [Vic Toews](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/07/justice-the-vic-toews-way/ "Justice Minister Extrodinare!") confirmed in an interview this week that the government is planning to introduce the "Defence of Religions Act." The new act would permit a civil marriage commissioner or a justice of the peace to refuse their public services to gays without consequence.

Oddly, as soon as the popular media picked up on the story, Prime Minister Stephen Harper pooh-poohed the notion, saying that the government is "determined to protect the rights of gay and lesbian citizens."

_Uh..._ Determined, eh? That, coming from a government that is [committed to re-voting](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/06/harper-to-resurrect-dead-issue/ "Perhaps that's not too scary.") on same-sex marriage. A government that happily kneeled to pressure from the anti-gay lobby to [delay the vote](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/when-is-the-vote/ "That's not that scary either, is it?") past its promised timeline. A government that recently appointed a [new ontario judge](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/new-ontario-judge/ "Scary is a relative term, after all.") who represented anti-gay groups in a bid to declare same-sex marriage _unconstitutional_. A government that [completely axed](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/tories-cut-equality-funding/ "Maybe they just want to save for a rainy day...") its most important (and gay-friendly) equality program despite a massive budget surplus. A government that [just appointed](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/darrel-reid-govt-gig/ "Maybe that's getting a little scary now...") the _president_ of Canada's most hysterical anti-gay lobby group as their newest Chief of Staff. Gee, that sounds pretty determined there, Stevey.

But, don't worry, folks! Harper says he's not scary! Although, come to think of it, I don't recall him saying the same about the rest of his party...
