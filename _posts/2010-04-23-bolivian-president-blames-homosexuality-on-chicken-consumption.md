![Cock: Does eating it make you gay?]({{'/wp-content/media/2010/04/cock.jpg' | relative_url}} "There was nothing I could do to resist this joke, sorry.")

Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia, has cocked many-an-eyebrow this week after declaring that eating chicken will turn straight men gay.

(I guess I see how one could make that mistake.)

Specifically, Morales was referring to the poultry industry's practice of injecting chickens with female hormones to promote the growth of white meat, which is substantially more popular than dark meat. "When men eat those chickens," Morales stated, "they experience deviances in being men."

Fortunately for all my straight crushes, there is zero evidence to support Morale's assertion. Not that it would have stopped me from preparing all those delicious blackened chicken dinners. You know, just in case.
