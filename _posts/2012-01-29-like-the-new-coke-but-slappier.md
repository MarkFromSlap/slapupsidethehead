Slap's got a new format and schedule! Due to persistent interference from Real Lifeâ„¢, regular illustrated posts now happen on everyone's favourite day of the week: Monday! There'll also be a bunch of brand new _mini Slaps_ throughout the week featuring smaller stories that may not otherwise get much attention. And Terrible Friday Comics may rear its unpopular head, if you're _extra_ unlucky. So check out the new site, and feel free to send me two cents. (I need some pennies to complete my last roll, you see.)
