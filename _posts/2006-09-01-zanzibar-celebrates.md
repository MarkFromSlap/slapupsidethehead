Queen fans need not rejoice. At least, not in [Zanzibar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar "Time for a geography lesson."). The _Zanzibar's Association for Islamic Mobilization and Propagation_ is demanding that the government shut down a local restaurant's planned 60th birthday celebration for the late [Freddy Mercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Mercury "Music legend"). Although Freddy is the island's most recognizable export, the group strongly objects to the fact that Freddy was... well, I'll put it in his own words: "as gay as a daffodil, my dear!"

The radical religious group, which obviously thinks sexual orientation ought to overshadow all one's accomplishments and tourism potential, successfully shut down a local gay man's birthday party last year. Gee whiz. Why can't these nuts just be cool, relax, get hip... and so forth?
