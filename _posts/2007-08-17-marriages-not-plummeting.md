![Toronto Same-Sex Marriages](/wp-content/media/2007/08/toronto-gay-marriages.jpg)

Last June, Reuters [announced](http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=uri:2007-06-22T222137Z_01_N22198155_RTRIDST_0_CANADA-SAMESEX-WEDDINGS-COL.XML&pageNumber=0&summit= "Uh, fact checking anyone?") that only a single Canadian same-sex marriage was performed in Toronto so far this year, compared to 107 last year. The anti-gay crowd has, of course, framed the article, surrounded it with candles and gold, and trotted it about the country chanting something along the lines of "I told you so!"

Why, just this month Barabara Kay---an editorialist for the National Post---declared: "The conclusion they can fairly draw from [Toronto's] stats is that gay marriage was never more than an ideological symbol."

Now, ignoring for a moment that it doesn't bloody-well matter how few Canadians apply for same-sex marriages---it's about equality, not quantity---it turns out that Reuters got the statistics _very_ wrong.

As of early August, 182 of the same-sex marriages issued in Toronto since January were registered to Canadian addresses, not just a lonely one; and, last year, 518 Canadian gay couples got hitched in the city, not 107.
