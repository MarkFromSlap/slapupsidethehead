Great news for all our friends in the States! The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling today declaring that California's Proposition 8 (which banned same-sex marriage in the state) is unconstitutional! I wonder if opponents of marriage equality will now finally give up and admit they're on the wrong side of history, or if they'll carry onward and magnify their already-secured historical humiliation. (Actually, somehow I already know the answer.) At any rate, congratulations to all my friends to the south on this important win!
