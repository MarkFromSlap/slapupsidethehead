![What a lovely place...]({{'/wp-content/media/2006/05/moscow.jpg' | relative_url}})

Even _moose and squirrel_ must be shaking their heads at this news. Moscow's first gay pride parade, which was to peacefully conclude by placing flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, was met by hordes of violent protesters who started punching and kicking the participants. What's even sadder, the authorities did little to stop the violence, instead condemning the parade. The mayor and courts even banned the march, citing, well... nothing, really.

Canadian gay rights activist, John Fisher, was there.

> What I saw was a complete failure of police protection that was directly linked to the mayor's banning of the march. We can only hope that what we saw was representative of only a small segment of society.

Of course, there's not much joking I can do with this shameful material, so I'll conclude by congratulating the pride marchers for taking a stand against such nonsense, and I wish them all the best next year! Don't give up!
