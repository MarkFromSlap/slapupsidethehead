An anti-gay lobby group called Scotland for Marriage is [publishing the results of an in-house poll](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/15/scottish-anti-marriage-equality-group-to-launch-misleading-poll-ads-today/) which claims that a majority of Scotspersons opposes equal marriage rights, a deviation from what reputable polling companies suggest. Perhaps this difference can be explained by the wording of the question, which asks if you agree with the following statement: "Since gay and lesbian couples already have the same rights as married couples available to them under civil partnership, they should not be allowed to redefine marriage for everyone else." Uhh...
