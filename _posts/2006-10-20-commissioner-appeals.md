A Manitoba civil marriage commissioner is appealing to the Queen's Bench after his commissioner's license was suspended for denying public services to a same-sex couple. Kevin Kisilowsky claims that by having to serve all people equally, his religious freedoms as a Christian were horribly violated. The poor dear!

Interesting stuff, though! I wasn't aware that Christianity forbids followers from providing non-religious civil services to gays! "_Thou shalt refuse thy job to the gayeth ones._" Hmm... I guess that means I had better look around _extra_ carefully for someone to renew my drivers license this week.
