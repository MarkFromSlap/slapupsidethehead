![If you think Mr. Villainfurnace is bad, try Count Horrorcastle Von Evilterror](/wp-content/media/2009/06/mister-villainfurnace.jpg "If you think Mr. Villainfurnace is bad, try Count Horrorcastle Von Evilterror") A bill that would have set up an appeal process for refugees who think they have been unfairly rejected has been quietly abandoned. Bill C-291, which passed second reading this spring, has since been parked without additional debate after being forwarded to a Citizenship and Immigration committee. Now that summer is here, the bill has been effectively killed, left languishing on the table. Bill C-291  is of particular importance to gay refugees, as Canada [has a terrible record of handling gay claimants](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/tag/refugees/ "I've lost count, but here's the stories!"). Those seeking to gain refuge from countries where homosexuality is illegal are often asked for exhaustive evidence of their gayness despite a pressing need to have hid all such evidence for their own safety. It's not all bad, though; as consolation, rejected claimants are given a complimentary copy of Joseph Heller's _Catch 22_.
