_And Tango Makes Three_, a children's picture book about penguins at the Central Park Zoo was the most challenged book for the third consecutive year, according to the American Library Association.

The book recounts---through delightfully charming watercolour illustrations---the true story of two male chinstrap penguins at the Central Park Zoo who incubate and hatch an abandoned egg, raising it as their own. The picture book generated more formal complaints and was pulled off more Library shelves than any other book in 2008, with most complainants criticizing it for being "anti-family," "pro-gay," and "anti-religion." (I'd just call it "pro-adorable.")

GAFPA, The _Gay, Athiest, Family-Destroying Penguin Association_, has issued a press-release, calling the book censorship "Chirpichirpi-_Quaaaah_!"
