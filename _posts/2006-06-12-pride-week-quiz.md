![Pride Week Quiz](/wp-content/media/2006/06/pride_quiz.jpg)

It's that time of year! Cities everywhere are celebrating Pride, and Canada's largest, [Toronto Pride Week](http://www.pridetoronto.com/ "I was there last year; it was amazing!"), is exactly one week away! But one urban university---located a stone-throw away from the heart of Toronto's vibrant gay community---is celebrating in a very _special_ way.

[Ryerson University](http://www.ryerson.ca/ "Boooooooo") will be presenting an honorary degree to notoriously anti-gay lobbyist, Margaret Somerville. **And** they've scheduled it to coincide with the Pride Week opening ceremonies. How thoughtful!

Anyway, Margaret---actually, shall we call her Margey? Margey is an "ethicist" and played a vital role in the equal marriage debate's losing anti-gay side. Uh, let me see if I can recall her arguments here...

Oh, yes, of course. Margey [claimed](http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0062.html "Warning: Anti-gay link") that children of same-sex parents (whom she calls " **gaybies** ," I kid you not) lose their fundamental human rights through same-sex marriage. Oh, but "civil unions" for same-sex couples are OK with her. You know, because "civil unioned" couples can provide _so_ much more for children than couples under the "marriage" label.

Regardless, students at Ryerson University have started an [online petition to disinvite Margey](http://www.petitiononline.com/5087MCT/petition.html "Wouldn't it be nice if this worked?") from receiving the honorary degree. I wish them the best of luck. Because otherwise anything an "ethicist" says _must_ be true, right?
