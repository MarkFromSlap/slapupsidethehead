OK, in your best "soup nazi" voice: **No reason for you! _Next!_**

Walter Wakula, former Tory riding president for Calgary West, will not be allowed to challenge incumbent ~~wacko~~ <ins>MP</ins>, [Rob Anders](/2006/07/homosexual-sex-marriage/ "Seriously, Vote Out Anders, folks! How much more idiocy can you take?"), for nomination. Absolutely no reason was given for Wakula's disqualification, leaving everyone to scratch their head noisily---an action that Tories seem to evoke quite easily these days.

Anders (who, incidentally, was my MP before I got the hell out of Calgary), is best known as the sole dissenter in giving Nelson Mandela honorary Canadian citizenship, calling the man a communist and a terrorist. _I_ remember Anders more for his [crafting of flyers](/2006/07/homosexual-sex-marriage/ "And boy, do they fly!") that linked crystal meth usage to "homosexual sex marriage" and mailing them _to the wrong constituency_.

So, why wouldn't the conservative party allow a less controversial MP to run alongside Anders for the nomination when a clearly qualified former riding president is available? My guess: Anders is an undercover alien involved in a large conspiracy to slightly warm the rightmost chairs in the House of Commons! This is top secret stuff, folks...
