Well, I'm on the road---gone to Atlanta, U.S.A. for a lovely few days of unbearable boredom, followed by a trip out west to see family before flights get expensive.

Hey! Let's do the news roundup thing!

Qu√©bec's "gay baby" campaign, featuring a picture of a newborn with a "homosexual" hospital armband, has been [imported to Europe](http://www.artthreat.net/2007/11/324 "Another Canadian export, eh?"). While the campaign was praised in Canada, LGBT groups in Italy have criticized it for correlating homosexuality with disease. Conservative groups in Italy have also criticized the ad, presumably for, _oh_, not condemning gays to the sulfurous caverns of purgatory.

Canadian Blood Services [met with students](http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&articleID=1087&month=11&day=13&year=2007 "For another informative demonstration on stubbornness") at the University of Western Ontario to clarify their policy to permanently bar gay male blood donors. Apparently, instead of "traditional" blood, gay men feature a different, incompatible circulatory fluid: homo-bismol.

A special Remembrance Day wreath [honouring Canada's gay veterans](http://winnipegsun.com/News/Canada/2007/11/12/4649279-sun.html "Yes, they exist") was laid during Ottawa's ceremonies on Sunday. Instead of poppies, the wreath featured pink carnations. Next for the wreath-laying organization: trademark the carnation image and [legally threaten anyone else](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2006/11/08/white-poppy.html?ref=rss "In the spirit of honoring our soldiers") who tries to honour war dead with the flower.

Until Friday, kids!
