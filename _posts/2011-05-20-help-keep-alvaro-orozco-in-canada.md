![Alvaro Orozco for Senate]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/05/alvaro-for-senate.jpg' | relative_url}} "It's the only way...")

Alvaro Orozco, a gay Nicaraguan who unsuccessfully attempted a refugee claim in 2007, was arrested late last week in Toronto while waiting for a bus on his way out to dinner with a friend. He's now being held in detention without bail, and can be deported at any moment---unless he gets some serious community help.

I had posted several stories about Alvaro before he went into hiding, including a [guest post (by proxy) from Alvaro himself](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/09/gay-refugee-speaks/ "Gay Refugee Speaks"). His story was typical for gay refugee claimants in Canada: He fled a country where homosexuality is illegal, but was denied refugee status because he wasn't deemed gay enough by the adjudicator. Many refugee claimants are asked to provide impossible proof that they are gay, despite having to have hid all such evidence in their home country. In Alvaro's case, the adjudicator questioned why he hadn't actively sought out sexual partners while he was travelling up to Canada through the States. He was 14 at the time.

Since arriving in Canada, Alvaro has established himself in Toronto as a photographer, artist, and activist. Now 25, he has been hiding from immigration while awaiting the status on his last-resort Humanitarian and Compassionate application. This arrest puts his entire future in jeopardy, particularly since his story has already reached mainstream Nicaraguan newspapers and homosexuality, while now legal there, is widely not accepted..

Alvaro's future can be influenced by community support, but we need to take action now. If you have a few seconds right now, please sign this online petition to [Let Alvaro Stay in Canada](http://www.change.org/petitions/let-alvaro-stay-in-canada "It will only take a few seconds."). (Believe it or not, in refugee cases, community support like this can actually have a strong influence on the outcome.) Also, you can join the [Let Alvaro Stay Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/letalvarostay "Again, for refugee cases, these kind of things can help!") where information about events and other avenues of support are posted. A lot of his personal friends are there too, so you can learn more about Alvaro's story, his artwork, and community activities while you're there.

Me, I'll be pushing for Prime Minister Stephen Harper to give Alvaro a seat in the Canadian Senate. As you already know, many Canadians who have run into trouble with the law or have been rejected by voters (and thus society in general), have been appointed to the senate where they can safely ~~sleep~~ serve until they reach the age of 75---with a generous salary to boot. Normally I'd say this would be a long shot but, considering recent senate appointees... Alvaro's head and shoulders above the lot of them.

Of course, whatever happens, we're thinking of you, Alvaro!
