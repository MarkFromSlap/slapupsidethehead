Ice cream maker Ben and Jerry's has [renamed a flavour](http://www.benjerry.co.uk/our-values/appleyeverafter) of their signature frozen treat from _Oh! My! Apple Pie!_ to _Apple-y Ever After_ as a way of showing their support for same-sex marriage in the UK. Opponents of equality are now reportedly lobbying for their own flavour introduction: _Living in Sinnamon_.
