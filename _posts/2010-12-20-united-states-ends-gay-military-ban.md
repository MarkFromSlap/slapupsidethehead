The United States Senate voted on Saturday to _finally_ end their ban on having gays serve openly in the military. This is an important step toward full equality, so congratulations to all my stateside friends!

Anti-gay politicians and lobbyists are positively terrified, having already begun predicting consequences of an impossibly dire nature. The arguments mostly involve something about straight soldiers being distracted by their (now openly) gay colleagues, becoming overwhelmed with concern about whether or not other soliders are checking them out---and a distracted solider, they say, can _cost lives_.

Personally, I'd say bad soliders cost lives, and anyone who is more concerned about what their gay colleagues may or may not be thinking---instead of, say, incoming fire---sounds like a pretty bad solider to me.

If anything, Don't Ask, Don't Tell probably left the military more vulnerable to blackmail, as learning that someone is gay instantly gives anyone with shady motives leverage over a gay service member's military career. But opponents are entitled to their own narratives, I suppose...

Canada, by the way, ended its ban in 1992.
