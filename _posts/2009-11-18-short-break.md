Hey kids; I need to take an unscheduled break for a bit. Regular updates will resume soon, though! In the meantime, here's a few news tidbits of interest:

In Washington D.C., the Catholic Church has [threatened to stop all of its social aid programs](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/11/AR2009111116943.html), including shelter for the homeless, if a same-sex marriage bill before the D.C. council passes. Hmm... Using the needy as pawns for political ends; Jesus totally would have been into that, right? (Hat tip to John for the story.)

Ang Ladlad, an LGBT movement seeking party status in the Philippines has been [rejected a second time](http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/comelec-rejects-ladlad-petition-anew) by the Commission on Elections for "advocating immoral doctrines." Interesting choice of words. I guess that's some sort of new code for ending workplace and housing discrimination for gays. (Hat tip to Pinoy Pride for the story.)

On the weirder side of things, teen singer Miley Cyrus is coming under heat for [changing her song lyrics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCf_mXVc2xc) from "you're vain, your games, you're insecure" to "you're vain, you're gay, you're insecure" during a live performance. Maybe it's just me, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and chalk this up to a slip of the tongue. (Hat tip to Jessica for the story.)
