![LA-LA-LA-LA! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/04/lalala-i-cant-hear-you.jpg' | relative_url}} "LA-LA-LA-LA! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!")

Well, this is getting bizarre! Wednesday's [silly little story](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/04/alberta-defines-gay-spouses-as-benefits-partners/ "Who'd have thought it'd prompt two Slaps in one week?") about the Alberta government defining same-sex couples as "benefit partners" instead of "spouses" in their employee benefit plan is causing more of a stir than expected.

Same-sex marriage is a legal reality in Canada, but Alberta's gay government workers are being categorized differently. It should be a no-brainer to remedy this and move on---or so you'd think.

Lloyd Snelgrove, an Alberta cabinet minister and president of the treasury board, is continuing to defend the separate-but-equal treatment in the benefit plan, saying that the government's benefit plan shouldn't be used to "drive social change" and that anyone who has a problem with it should go to the Human Rights Commission instead of the plan's source.

"Drive social change?" Same-sex marriage has been legal in Alberta since 2005; the change already happened. Surely this is just a matter of updating the books to keep consistent. But even Alberta's premier, Ed Stelmach, has now come out against calling same-sex spouses "spouses" in the plan: "The benefits are the same," he said during Wednesday's question period, "and that's the most important thing."

It's true: The benefits are the same---just like the water that leads to separate drinking fountains come from the same pipes, but something's still not right. It's a clich√©, but one apparently requires repeating: Separate but equal is not equal. The Alberta government should just acknowledge reality, update the darn plan, and move on to something more important.
