![Also relieves fear caused by crazy delusion.]({{'/wp-content/media/2009/03/rights-medication.jpg' | relative_url}} "Also relieves fear caused by crazy delusion.")

Alberta will amend their provincial human rights legislation to explicitly protect gays from discrimination.

Culture Minister, Lindsay Blackett, who [just last month](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/02/alberta-still-dragging-feet-on-gay-rights/ "Mood swing often?") said that updating the province's human rights legislation to include gays would be a "knee-jerk response," has apparently jerked his knee, giving him ample recovery time to draft up the much-needed legislation.

Alberta was the only province in Canada to not include gays in their human rights laws, despite a decade-old Supreme Court ruling requiring it.
