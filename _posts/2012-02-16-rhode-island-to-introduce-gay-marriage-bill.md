It looks like Rhode Island legislators are [prepared to introduce three equal rights bills today](http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/02/gay-rights-bill.html), including one that proposes full marriage equality in the state. Well, there you go! Just because a state is small doesn't mean its minds are too.
