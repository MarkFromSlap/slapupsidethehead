The Trails End Farmer's Market in London, Ontario is the subject of a human rights complaint after the market owner forced a vendor to remove a trans employee from their stand.

Karen Clarke, owner of the True 2 You candle company, said she was shocked to have received a call from Trails End demanding that she either fire a trans employee, or take her business to another market. "He said [the trans employee] made everyone uncomfortable," Karen told the media. "'It's just not a family place'---he kept repeating that over and over again."

Ed Kikkert, owner of the market, defended his actions to the media: "I'm not discriminating at all," he said. "I'm just asking which washroom would they use?" He continued, "How can you go into a men's washroom dressed as a lady, how can you go into the ladies washroom when you're a man; that's the difficulty I have. It's not discriminating at all."

That's a defense? Yeah, good luck with that one in front of the human rights commission.

A petition has been started to [boycott the Trails End market](http://www.change.org/petitions/trails-end-farmers-market-stop-discriminating-against-transgender-people-in-london-on-canada "Go sign. Now. It'll take two seconds, really!"), which already has over 4,000 signatures.
