![Every day, I work surrounded by flowers... And they fill me with SO MUCH HATRED!]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/03/flower-hate.jpg' | relative_url}} "It's the pollen, I think")

A New Brunswick florist is refusing to provide flowers to a couple on their wedding day because they're lesbians.

Kim Evans, owner of the _Petals and Promises_, wrote a letter to the couple declaring that she would, under no circumstances, sell them flowers. "As a born-again Christian," she wrote, "I must respect my conscience before God and have no part in this matter."

So, God forbids selling commercial products to gay people now?

Well, I guess everyone's free to horribly misinterpret their religion---except it's illegal in New Brunswick to deny business to anyone based on their race, religion, or sexual orientation. And that's just as it should be, otherwise society can just go back to putting up "no coloreds," "no Jews," and "no pansies" signs in their windows. (Well, unless a shop happens to be sold out of pansies.)

The couple's wedding planner, Mario Bourgeois Leduc, has brought Ms. Evan's behaviour to the attention of the media because he was particularly disturbed by the incident. "Even though people think discrimination and homophobia is almost nill, that is not the reality," he told QMI agency yesterday. "That negativity is there from Day One if you're a same-sex couple planning the most important day of your life."

Indeed, gay people put up with a lot more nonsense than most people realize. Under no circumstances should anyone be afraid of being denied public services---be they flowers, an [apartment](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2010/06/religious-freedom-doesnt-give-you-that-power/ "Religious Freedom Doesn't Give You That Power"), [lodging](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/11/lesbian-couple-denied-basement-suite/ "Lesbian Couple Denied Basement Suite"), or anything else---simply because of who they are. Yet it remains a real fear for gay people.

So, to Ms. Evans:

Roses are red  
Violets are blue  
You're a douche  
A **giant** douche.

Have a great weekend, kids!
