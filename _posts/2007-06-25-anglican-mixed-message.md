![Anglican Church Flip Flops]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/06/church-flip-flops.jpg' | relative_url}})

The Canadian Anglican Church has decreed that the blessing of same-sex unions is perfectly compatible with their core doctrine. Hours later, they forbid the blessing of same-sex unions.

With these votes, gay Anglicans have been sent a clear and decisive message: Your church thinks your relationships are worthy of their full blessing, but they, uh, _just_ don't feel like doing it right now.

Canadian Anglicans had spent months preparing for this decision, during which time the global Anglican community issued an ultimatum [threatening to shut down "errant" churches](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/church-threatened-shutdown/ "They love their parishes so much"). (I think the official wording was something like: "Stop blessing gays or there'll be _no_ church for _anyone_!") While several Anglican denominations supported gay blessings, yesterday's vote means they won't be able to continue the practice.
