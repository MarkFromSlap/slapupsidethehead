![Pile o' Slaps Volume II](/wp-content/media/2008/02/pile-o-slaps-v2.jpg)

In my web travels, I often collect stories that I _intend_ to share, but then become distracted by newer, shinier stories---or feel too lazy to illustrate them. This is what becomes of those stories: a **[Pile o' Slaps](/category/pile-o-slaps/ "Part two of the ongoing saga, like sand in the hourglass...")**!

Dr. Brent Hawkes, a Toronto pastor and gay rights activist, has [received the prestigious Order of Canada](http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2008/21/c4378.html "Do you think they offer these to gay website authors, too?") in recognition of his fight toward equal rights for gay people. I shall start the betting odds at 946341:Â¾ that an anti-gay lobbyist will burst a capillary over this within a week.

The rift between Canadian Anglicans is continuing to grow. A Vancouver congregation has voted to [leave the country](http://www.anglicanjournal.com/100/article/vancouver-church-votes-to-leave-canadian-church/ "I ran away from home after a temper tantrum when I was four") in favour of The Province of the Southern Cone in South America, which does [not think of gay people as favourably](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/11/bishop-leaves-canada/ "Bishops love this, I guess"). Authorities in The Province of the Southern Cone expressed overwhelming gratitude toward the Vancouver church for knowing that The Province of the Southern Cone exists.

The gay-targeting zombie lynch mobs in Jamaica are finally getting some media attention thanks in part to [Gareth Henry's fight](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/02/jamaican-seeks-refuge/ "No jokes here; I wish him the best") to stay in Canada. A [New York Times feature on Jamaica](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/world/americas/24jamaica.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&oref=slogin "A terrifying read") describes some of the horror. <small>(Hat tip to <a href="http://montrealsimon.blogspot.com/2008/02/shining-light-on-jamaicas-homophobic.html" title="He's taken up the cause">Montreal Simon</a>)</small>

Speaking of Canadian Refugees, Capital Xtra has an excellent article outlining [the frustrating process](http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=2&STORY_ID=4375&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=4 "Canada's own Catch-22") that refugee claimants must go through to prove they're gay after years of effort to hide their sexuality in their home country. It's a great lesson for future refugees: If you truly desire to protect yourself, put yourself in as much visible danger as possible.

A sports photographer has angered and confused Kentuckians after a newspaper published a photo of two male basketball players hugging in celebration of their victory. Columnist Pam Platt, in [a display of common sense](http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080113/COLUMNISTS10/801130429/1054/OPINION "EEEW! Men Touching at a sports event!"), offers no apology to the scores of offended readers, who will move on to picket the guy that accidentally brushed up against them on the public transit.
