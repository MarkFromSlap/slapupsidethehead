![Pile o\' Hugs](/wp-content/media/2008/07/pile-o-hugs.jpg "Hearts!")

In my web travels I often collect stories that I intend to share, but then become distracted by newer, shinier stories---or feel too lazy to illustrate them. This is what becomes of those stories: A [Pile o' Sla](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/category/pile-o-slaps/ "Other volumes are available. Collect them today!")... Hugs?

The Town of Truro, Nova Scotia---which made national news last year after some bizarre homophobic comments by its mayor---has finally [reached an agreement](http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=1&STORY_ID=5067&PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 "Fluffy kittens playing with yarn") with a local gay rights group, amending its employment equity policy to include sexual orientation. A strange outcome, considering the dispute [was over a flag-flying policy](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/08/gay-pride-flag/ "Woodland creatures prance through the wildflowers").

For the first time ever, Canada's Armed Forces [marched](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/06/29/gay-pride.html "Fuzzy bumblebees buzz in the spring") in Toronto's Gay Pride parade, promoting equal rights and openly recruiting gay servicemen and women. This is in stark contrast to the policies of the United States. I'd ask if you'd like me to describe them, but I'm afraid I can't tell.

A nation-wide poll shows that support for same-sex marriage in Canada [has climbed to 68%](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080629.wpoll30/BNStory/National/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20080629.wpoll30 "Shiny goldfish dart below the lillypads"). Recent converts cited a lack of family-destroying meteor showers for their change in opinion.

The top leader of Canada's Anglican Church is [standing up for gay-friendly denominations](http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=53d9ae2e-5127-4434-9b38-cacf81626c69 "Puppies paw at baby chicks") in the country, saying that ultra-conservative factions are obsessing over the wrong issues. Primate Fred Hiltz said it's unfortunate that some Christians are "preoccupied with sexual acts between homosexuals and falsely equate homosexuality with promiscuity," adding that they'd gain more credibility on sexual issues if they devoted the same energy to "combating sexual abuse, sexual exploitation by people in positions of power, and global sex slavery." Hmm... Combating something that everyone agrees needs combating; what a novel concept!

Same-sex marriages skyrocketed last month, as gay couples [plan their weddings around Pride celebrations](http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20080627/sam_sex_marriages_080627/20080627/?hub=TorontoNewHome "Mutant trantulas writhe in boiling acid"). Because if it weren't for that, no one would want a June wedding.

Well, have a great weekend kiddos, and **Happy Independance Day** to all my Stateside visitors. May it be nothing like the movie.
