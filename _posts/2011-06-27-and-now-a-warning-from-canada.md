So, I hear that New York State has finally legalized same-sex marriage. That's fantastic news!

Throughout the debate, however, many people were wondering aloud about the consequences---both direct and indirect---that should be expected. Some of the predictions are downright dire.

I think I can chime in here. The first legal same-sex marriages in Canada happened in 2003, eight years ago---and it's been nearly six years since Canada legalized same-sex marriage nationwide via parliamentary vote. In that sense, looking at Canada is a _little_ bit like looking into the future. I think, therefore, that I should warn all you New Yorkers about the consequences that same-sex marriage will bring.

For easy reference and discussion, I've compiled each consequence into an exhaustive, numbered list. New York will experience each of these consequences, and I encourage other states to think long and hard about each of the items on this list before deciding to go down the path of same-sex marriage as well.

So, without further ado, if you're ready, I present the complete of consequences of legal same-sex marriage:

1. Same-sex couples can marry.

There you go. Now no one can say that they haven't been informed.

Congratulations, again, to all my friends in New York. Keep fighting, and all the other states _will_ follow!
