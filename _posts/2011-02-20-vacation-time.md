Well, I'm off visiting somewhere a lot warmer this week to help make up for spending all last summer with an arm cast and a bottle of tylenol, glowering bitterly at everyone else enjoying their intact skeletal systems. You can expect some nifty guest posts coming up, though. And if you haven't already, remember to [Slap into Action](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/action/) and help put an end to phony "gay-curing" charities in Canada!
