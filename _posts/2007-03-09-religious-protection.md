I guess there's an ill-reported _eleventh commandment_ to note!

Religious conservatives in New Brunswick are positively rhapsodic over a Tory-introduced bill, known as Bill 37, that will allow government servants to refuse civil marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The bill, according to the Christian lobby group _Canada Family Action Coalition_, will protect the religious freedoms of civil servants.

Hey, how about that? Did you know that Christianity forbids its followers from [performing secular duties](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/making-wed-gays/ "I probably should have picked a better title for this one, though...") for gays? I was raised Roman Catholic, but must've skipped past that part of the bible. Luckily I didn't mention I was gay when I got my government health forms mailed out!

Both supporters and opponents of the bill admit that the whole idea is probably unconstitutional, and therefore illegal. But, now that the federal Conservatives have scrapped the [Court Challenges Program](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/09/go-fund-yourself/ "Go fund yourself!"), who can afford to challenge illegal laws anyway?

So who's next on the list of people to protect? Probably chauffeurs who just don't feel like transporting gays to city hall, bless their hearts. And, while we're on a roll, maybe those fundamentalist vendors who don't think women should be sold property of their own. Religious protections abound!
