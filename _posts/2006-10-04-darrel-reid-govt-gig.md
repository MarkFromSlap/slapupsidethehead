![Chief of Staff, Darrel Reid](/wp-content/media/2006/10/chief_of_staff.jpg)

Conservative Environment Minister Rona Ambrose quietly appointed the president of a notorious anti-gay lobby group as her new Chief of Staff last week.

Darrel Reid, former head of **Focus on the Family Canada** , actively lobbied against equal marriage _and_ the adding of sexual orientation to the list of minority groups protected from hate crimes in Canada. And now he has a spiffy new environment gig!

So, where does Darrel's new-found love of the environment come from? My guess: There are no gay trees. Although, come to think of it... Don't hermaphroditic organisms only mate with the same gender?
