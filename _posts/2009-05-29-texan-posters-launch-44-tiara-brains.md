![Ew.](/wp-content/media/2009/05/pile-o-slaps-6.jpg "Ew.")

In my web travels, I often collect stories that I _intend_ to share, but then become distracted by newer, shinier stories---or feel too lazy to illustrate them individually. This is what becomes of those stories: a **[Pile o' Slaps](/category/pile-o-slaps/ "Part six of the ongoing saga, like sands in the hourglass...")**!

A Texan mayor has announced that he's leaving the States to legally live with his lover, [a gay, illegal immigrant](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124294991033245475.html "So \*that's\* what that loud scream coming from the south was."). In other news, conservative Texans have been mysteriously exploding.

A progressive church in Québec has embraced the silly "Adam and Steve" play on words, [erecting a large anti-homophobia poster](http://montreal.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090527/mtl_Rosedalechurch_090527/20090527/?hub=MontrealHome "Complete with fig leaves to hide Adam and Steve's shameful parts.") with the slogan: "Si Jésus aimait Jean, pourquoi pas Adam et Steve?" Or, if I may flex my translation skills: "If Jesus loved John, why not Adam and Steve?", referring to a popular French expression about John being "the disciple Jesus loved." Already, the sign has caused controversy as some residents complain about its proximity to a school bus stop, and one enraged mother declaring "I don't care what people do in their bedroom but I don't have a picture of my husband and I naked with a fig leaf in front of our crotch outside my house." Err... Does that mean she _doesn't_ use the fig leaf?

Still on the topic of Québec, the province has announced that they will be [launching an anti-homophobia campaign](http://www.cjad.com/news/565/930044 "Québec's six hundreth of its kind.") by the end of the year. The campaign has been confirmed to be province wide, hopefully referring to Alberta---where it's needed most.

Speaking of which, the Alberta legislature is very, very close to passing the inappropriate Bill 44, legislation that will require teachers to receive parental permission before mentioning any gay topics in class, and to pull out any students whose parents don't approve. A good clue that this is a terrible idea: The National Post, Canada's largest right-wing newspaper, is already referring to it as [hillbilly human rights](http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/05/28/kevin-libin-alberta-opts-for-hillbilly-human-rights.aspx "How un-PC! They prefer to be called ").

Slap reader John writes in with a story about a gay student who [successfully ran as his high school's homecoming queen](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/05/fairfax-high-elects-gay-man-as-prom-queen-prompting-discussion-about-gender-roles.html "Does this mean he gets to dance with the homecoming king? Why didn't I think of that?"), complete with tiara rights. Congratulations!

Finally, Canada's capital city is examining the health of its arts scene and nightlife as more and more gay Ottawans leave for larger neighbouring cities, such as Toronto and Montréal. It's what city officials are dubbing the "[gay brain drain](http://www.xtra.ca/public/Ottawa/Does_Ottawa_suffer_from_gay_brain_drain-6832.aspx "I always just assumed gay men had their own gravity.")," but, uh, are they absolutely sure it's due to the arts scene and not, say, proximity to Stephen Harper?

Well, that's all for this Pile o' Slaps! Until next time, have a great weekend kids!
