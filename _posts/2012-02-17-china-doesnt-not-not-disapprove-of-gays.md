A dating website in China [is claiming](http://english.sina.com/china/2012/0212/439461.html) that over 80% of Chinese people born after 1980 "don't disapprove of homosexuality." I didn't not hesitate to not withhold this story, since I wasn't not unsure if the methodology wasn't unsound, but the results definitely don't not appear to not be discouraging!
