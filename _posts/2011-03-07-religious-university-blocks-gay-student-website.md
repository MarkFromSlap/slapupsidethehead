It shouldn't come as a surprise that gay people, from all different walks of life, are everywhere, including some not-so-gay-friendly places. Take, for example, Christian universities in the middle of Arkansas. But if you still demand proof, visit this heart-tuggingly amazing website by the gay students at Harding University: [HU Queer Press](http://huqueerpress.com/ "Amazing, inspiring stuff. With a great design to boot!").

Well, visit, unless you actually _go_ to Harding University, in which case you'll notice that the above link doesn't work. You see, one week after going live, the university has blocked all campus access to the website---a direct order from the campus president himself, David Burke.

Speaking to the press about his decision to censor the private website, Burke expressed his immense displeasure with the site's very existance: "I won't even publicly speak the web address---not because I think I can keep it from you, but because the address itself is offensive to me."

huqueerpress.com

_Scandalous!_

I can only imagine what Burke actually thinks of his queer students if he finds just the title of a website about them to be so terrible as to be... _unmentionable_.

Hmm... I wonder if Slap is blocked there? If not, I guess I mustn't be working hard enough.
