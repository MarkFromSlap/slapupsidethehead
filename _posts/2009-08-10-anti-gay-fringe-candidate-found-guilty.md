![That especially goes for his followers.](/wp-content/media/2009/08/god.jpg "That especially goes for his followers.")

David Popescu, the fringe candidate from Sudbury who [declared that all gay people should be killed](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2009/03/thats-not-religious-freedom/ "Pathetic.") while speaking in front of high school students at a candidate's debate, has been found guilty of inciting hatred under Canada's criminal code.

Good.

Popescu, already a sentenced criminal for striking his elderly mother in 2003, tried to shield his immoral actions behind a cowardly veil of religious beliefs, saying that he's just acting the way the bible wants him to. Thankfully, the courts do not accept that uttering death threats and inciting hatred toward an entire population is OK because one interprets their religious texts as such.
