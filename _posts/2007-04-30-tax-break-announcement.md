![Tax Overload!]({{'/wp-content/media/2007/04/tax-overload.jpg' | relative_url}})

Finally, a tax break for the hard-working gay guy!

Wait; I don't think that came out right. I hope I didn't give off the impression that taxes have been cut in any meaningful way. And certainly not for us gays---who, until last year, [couldn't even file as spouses](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/05/equal-taxes-for-all/ "Status quo has always been fair like that") like other couples. No, no. What I meant to say was that I'm taking a break from this site today to do my taxes.

In the meantime, though, let me extend a hearty thanks to our conservative government for giving us the 1% GST cut instead of implementing the opposition's income tax reduction. Now, in addition to paying a delightfully crippling amount of tax, I get to receive a smaller GST rebate this year!

Well, until Wednesday, folks: Has anyone seen my calculator? It's big and cumbersome, eats batteries faster than a flashlight in storage, and draws blocky graphs more slowly than it would take by hand.
