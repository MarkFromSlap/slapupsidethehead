One Million Moms, a US-based anti-gay lobby group, has demanded that Toys R Us pull an issue of Archie Comics featuring a gay wedding from its store shelves, or face an organized boycott. If you're thinking of heading down to Toys R Us to pick up a copy for yourself, though, you might not have much luck. According to Archie Comics, the issue [has completely sold out](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/mar/02/archie-gay-marriage-issue-sells-out "Hooray! And also boo because I didn't get one.")! Hey, do you think One Million Moms will boycott this site? I could use a new surge in readers!
