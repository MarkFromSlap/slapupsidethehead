![Jack Layton, in the style of Professor Layton, says that a gentleman always gives everyone a fair shake, Luke.]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/04/jack-layton.jpg' | relative_url}} "I heart my DS.")

So, there's an election happening in Canada. If you live here, I'm sure you've been following it very closely and consequently have lost most of your hair due to exasperated tugging. If you live outside of Canada, you're probably still up to speed since the international news media incessantly reports on Canadian politics, just like they do for the United States. (_Snicker._)

Now, with 308 seats up for grabs and most of the major parties running a candidate in each riding, there _should_ be some queer representation out there. And, indeed there is! According to Xtra, here's how it adds up:

At the top of the list, we've got the New Democratic Party (led by Jack Layton) which has 10 openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual candidates. Next up is the Green Party (led by Elizabeth May) with 5. The Liberal Party (led by Michael Ignatieff) comes in third place with 3. And, to the surprise of no one, the Conservatives (led by [Dillwad McHamsterface](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/tag/stephen-harper/ "Stephen Harper")) are dead last with zero.

These numbers are exactly what I'd expect. The NDP have always had a pretty good record in supporting equal rights for GLBT Canadians, alongside the Greens who also include equality in their platform. The Liberals are mostly supportive, with some division within the party, and the Conservatives, bafflingly, fight against equal rights with clockwork consistency, often even trying to strip these rights away. It's no wonder then, that GLBT Canadians with political aspirations are largely associating themselves with the NDP and Greens.

Will any of these translate into seats? That's a different question---and it's up to you. Yes, _you_. Well, unless you don't have Canadian citizenship, in which case please don't vote in this election. That'd be illegal.
