The Media Development Authority in Singapore has fined StarHub Cable Vision, the country's cable operator, for airing a music video that showed two women kissing. In a statement, the media authority called the kiss "a breach of the TV advertising guidelines, which disallows advertisements that condone homosexuality."

The cable operator has agreed to pay the fine and no longer show the music video.

Homosexuality is illegal in Singapore and media featuring gay people is often banned in the country. Earlier this year, for example, an X-Box game [was banned for featuring an alien lesbian couple](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2008/01/churches-xboxes-tories-oh-my/ "Homosexuality is particularly sinful for fictional alien species, I guess...").
