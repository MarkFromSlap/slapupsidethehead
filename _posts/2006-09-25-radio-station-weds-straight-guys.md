DJ Paul Brown, of the Edmonton radio station [The Bear](http://www.thebearrocks.com/ "As a former Edmontonian, let me say this radio station sucks."), has arranged for two straight male strangers to marry on the air. The stunt is part of the station's annual Really Tough contest, where people compete in "un-manly" challenges for a chance at a $40,000 top prize. (Incidentally, a coin toss was used to decide who had to wear a tuxedo, and who had to wear a bridal gown.)

Now, personally, I can't help but chuckle. I mean, the two guys obviously had a blast with the stunt, and really, it's far more of a knock against the classic "tough guy" image than anything else. (Definitely something one would expect from a morning radio show.) But, gee... How do you think the brilliant scribes at The Edmonton SUN are reporting this?

Oh, yes, right; this _brand new_ "loophole" is going to be horrendously exploited! Hurry, parliamentarians, while you still can, vote to revoke equal marriage rights! After all, before same-sex marriage was legal in Canada, it was absolutely _impossible_ for two strangers to marry. And marrying for pension or citizenship? A concept _surely_ never conceived before these gays came along.

This will be the first time I've explicitly written this in a post, but: _ **Slap!** _
