Don Harvey, an Anglican bishop, has become so distraught over gays being able to marry in Canada that he has decamped the country entirely. His destination: Southern Cone, a province in South America where gay rights are presumably unlikely to advance for several hundred dozen fiscal years.

Oh Don, whatever shall we do without you?

In related news, a choleric 7-year-old from Manitoba has run away from home after her parents insisted she eat her vegetables.
