![Sorry, Children...](/wp-content/media/2006/06/camp_closed.jpg)

The [Ontario Catholic Youth Leadership Camp](http://www.osc-koc.com/leadership_camp.htm "Closed to ") has officially closed its doors after one of its employees, James Loney, turned out to be gay. Loney, incidentally, was the Christian aid worker that was [kidnapped](http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/03/27/newloney-home060327.html "with his orientation kept secret, of course") earlier this year in Iraq. Uh, good thing he's now back in Canada where people are more tolerant...

Anyhoo, while Loney doesn't have definitive proof of why the camp closed, the Knights of Columbus, which finances the camp, was clearly nervous about this whole "gayness" deal. In a phone call, the knighties made it clear that having Loney on board signaled that the camp was "promoting the homosexual lifestyle." The 14-year-old camp closed immediately thereafter to _revise its mission statement_. (Uh, overreact much, knighties?)

Well, sorry kids. But there's always next year! Well, unless us pesky homosexuals don't quit or uncloset ourselves, anyway. Happy summer vacation!
