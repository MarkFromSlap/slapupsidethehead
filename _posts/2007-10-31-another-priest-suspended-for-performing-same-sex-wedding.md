OK, I've lost count.

Reverend Michael Bury from St. John the Evangelist church in Stirling, Ontario has had his marriage license suspended after performing a same-sex marriage back in August. As an added measure, he has been ordered not to attend church until January.

The man is on medical leave.

Reverend Bury, of course, is [definitely](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2006/10/church-suspends-archibishop/ "I need a golf clicker.") [not](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/priest-removed/ "This happens far too frequently.") [the](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/05/priest-resigns/ "And I'm running out of illustration ideas for this topic.") [first](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/03/another-priest-fired/ "So many ejected priests, so few art supplies...") [priest](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/02/priest-removed/ "Would anyone notice if I just re-used the same illustrations?") to be disciplined for supporting his gay parishioners. And, as is the case here, most of the disciplinary actions have come from the Anglican church, which has been oddly contradictory about gay blessings recently.

In June, the General Synod decreed that blessing same-sex couples did _not_ conflict with church doctrine, then promptly [voted to ban the practice](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/06/anglican-mixed-message/ "Makes perfect sense, no?"). This month, the Ontario and Montr√©al dioceses voted to [allow same-sex blessings](http://www.slapupsidethehead.com/2007/10/same-sex-blessings/ "Well, kind of.").

Hmm... Reverend Bury is from Ontario; I guess this makes their decision non-retroactive.

Well, until Friday, have a safe and happy Halloween! If you don't have a costume yet, here's an idea: Go as a wacky contradiction! Just fine some Anglican garb and...
