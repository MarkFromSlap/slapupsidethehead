The world of sports is notoriously homophobic, but one girls' high school hockey team in New Brunswick has come up with a novel way to counter it. After experiencing negativity and discrimination first-hand over having two lesbian teammates, the Woodstock High School Lady Thunder hockey team distributed tons of rainbow buttons for supporters to wear at their games. Eventually, teammates, coaches, parents---and even rival teams---began wearing the buttons.

S_porting_ the unique buttons has now _netted_ the team a human rights award from the provincial commission. Score!
