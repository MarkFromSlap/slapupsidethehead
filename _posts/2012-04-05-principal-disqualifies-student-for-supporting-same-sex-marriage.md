An assistant principal at Fullerton Union High School in California [interrupted and disqualified a student](http://www.voiceofoc.org/countywide/this_just_in/article_f51f86da-7e9b-11e1-8fda-001a4bcf887a.html) competing for the title of Mr. Fullerton (A silly contest the school has going on, apparently) because the student said he hopes that same-sex marriage will be legal in California so that he can get married one day. The student, who was answering a question about where he sees himself in ten years, was ushered off stage in front of hundreds of parents and other students. The assistant principal has since apologized to the student, and---I presume---all other gay people for having probably supported Proposition 8.
