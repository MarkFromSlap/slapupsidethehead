![A scientist inspects a sample of water:]({{'/wp-content/media/2011/11/gay-water.jpg' | relative_url}} "We can either filter the water, or add 3240 ppm of straight to bring it back to its acceptable 10 to 1 ratio.")

If you're gay and ever wondered why you're not straight, perhaps you've just been drinking too much Peruvian tap water.

José BenÃ­tez---the mayor of Huarmey, a small town located in the Ancash region of Peru---is convinced his town's water supply is causing heterosexual men to turn gay. The bizarre comments, which were uttered at the launch of a project designed to improve water distribution, seem to have stemmed from an television report back in 2000. The report famously claimed that the 14,000 residents of the town of Tabalosis---which happens to be the source of Huarmey's water---were all gay men.

While Peruvians are left scratching their heads over the whole spectacle, I suppose there's a small benefit to come out of this. Mayor BenÃ­tez has apparently stumbled upon the physical manifestation of pure gay: A metallic element called strontium (Chemical symbol Sr, atomic weight 38), which occurs in higher-than-normal levels in his town's water.

And I thought the only thing strontium caused was cancer. Go figure!
