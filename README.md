# www.slapupsidethehead.com

From about 2006 to 2011, I shared and illustrated LGBT+ news, with a focus on Canadian content. The site was called Slap Upside the Head, and was originally hosted using Wordpress on a shared hosting environment. I've since converted and archived the content as a static website, which is the repo you're looking at now.
